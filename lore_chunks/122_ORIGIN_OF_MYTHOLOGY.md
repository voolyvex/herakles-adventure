ORIGIN OF MYTHOLOGY
  HAVING reached the close of our series of stories of Pagan
  mythology, an inquiry suggests itself. "Whence came these stories?
  Have they a foundation in truth, or are they simply dreams of the
  imagination?" Philosophers have suggested various theories of the
  subject; and 1. The Scriptural theory; according to which all
  mythological legends are derived from the narratives of Scriptures,
  though the real facts have been disguised and altered. Thus
  Deucalion is only another name for Noah, Hercules for Samson, Arion
  for Jonah, etc. Sir Walter Raleigh, in his "History of the World,"
  says, "Jubal, Tubal, and Tubal-Cain were Mercury, Vulcan, and
  Apollo, inventors of Pasturage, Smithing, and Music. The Dragon
  which kept the golden apples was the serpent that beguiled Eve.
  Nimrod's tower was the attempt of the Giants against Heaven." There
  are doubtless many curious coincidences like these, but the theory
  cannot without extravagance be pushed so far as to account for any
  great proportion of the stories.
  2. The Historical theory; according to which all the persons
  mentioned in mythology were once real human beings, and the legends
  and fabulous traditions relating to them are merely the additions
  and embellishments of later times. Thus the story of AEolus, the
  king and god of the winds, is supposed to have risen from the fact
  that AEolus was the ruler of some islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea, where
  be reigned as a just and pious king, and taught the natives the use of
  sails for or ships, and how to tell from the signs of the atmosphere
  the changes of the weather and the winds. Cadmus, who, the legend
  says, sowed the earth with dragon's teeth, from which sprang a crop of
  armed men, was in fact an emigrant from Phoenicia, and brought with
  him into Greece the knowledge of the letters of the alphabet, which be
  taught to the natives. From these rudiments of learning sprung
  civilization, which the poets have always been prone to describe as
  a deterioration of man's first estate, the Golden Age of innocence and
  simplicity.
  3. The Allegorical theory supposes that all the myths of the
  ancients were allegorical and symbolical, and contained some moral,
  religious, or philosophical truth or historical fact, under the form
  of an allegory, but came in process of time to be understood
  literally. Thus Saturn, who devours his own children, is the same
  power whom the Greeks called Cronos (Time), which may truly be said to
  destroy whatever it has brought into existence. The story of Io is
  interpreted in a similar manner. Io is the moon, and Argus the
  starry sky, which, as it were, keeps sleepless watch over her. The
  fabulous wanderings of lo represent the continual revolutions of the
  moon, which also suggested to Milton the same idea.

  "To behold the wandering moon
  Riding near her highest noon,
  Like one that had been led astray
  In the heaven's wide, pathless way."
  Il Penseroso.

  4. The Physical theory; according to which the elements of air,
  fire, and water were originally the objects of religious adoration,
  and the principal deities were personifications of the powers of
  nature. The transition was easy from a personification of the elements
  to the notion of supernatural beings presiding over and governing
  the different objects of nature. The Greeks, whose imagination was
  lively, peopled all nature with invisible beings, and supposed that
  every object, from the sun and sea to the smallest fountain and
  rivulet, was under the care of some particular divinity. Wordsworth,
  in his "Excursion," has beautifully developed this view of Grecian
  mythology:

  "In that fair clime the lonely herdsman, stretched
  On the soft grass through half a summer's day,
  With music lulled his indolent repose;
  And, in some fit of weariness, if he,
  When his own breath was silent, chanced to hear
  A distant strain far sweeter than the sounds
  Which his poor skill could make, his fancy fetched
  Even from the blazing chariot of the Sun
  A beardless youth who touched a golden lute,
  And filled the illumined groves with ravishment.
  The mighty hunter, lifting up his eyes
  Toward the crescent Moon, with grateful heart
  Called on the lovely Wanderer who bestowed
  That timely light to share his joyous sport;
  And hence a beaming goddess with her nymphs
  Across the lawn and through the darksome grove
  (Not unaccompanied with tuneful notes
  By echo multiplied from rock or cave)
  Swept in the storm of chase, as moon and stars
  Glance rapidly along the clouded heaven
  When winds are blowing strong. The Traveller slaked
  His thirst from rill or gushing fount, and thanked
  The Naiad. Sunbeams upon distant hills
  Gliding apace with shadows in their train,
  Might, with small help from fancy, be transformed
  Into fleet Oreads sporting visibly.
  The Zephyrs, fanning, as they passed, their wings,
  Lacked not for love fair objects whom they wooed
  With gentle whisper. Withered boughs grotesque,
  Stripped of their leaves and twigs by hoary age,
  From depth of shaggy covert peeping forth
  In the low vale, or on steep mountain side;
  And sometimes intermixed with stirring horns
  Of the live deer, or goat's depending beard;
  These were the lurking Satyrs, a wild brood
  Of gamesome deities; or Pan himself,
  That simple shepherd's awe-inspiring god."

  All the theories which have been mentioned are true to a certain
  extent. It would therefore be more correct to say that the mythology
  of a nation has sprung from all these sources combined than from any
  one in particular. We may add also that there are many myths which
  have arisen from the desire of man to account for those natural
  phenomena which he cannot understand; and not a few have had their
  rise from a similar desire of giving a reason for the names of
  places and persons.
