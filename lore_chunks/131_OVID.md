OVID,
  often alluded to in poetry by his other name of Naso, was born in
  the year 43 B.C. He was educated for public life and held some offices
  of considerable dignity, but poetry was his delight, and he early
  resolved to devote himself to it. He accordingly sought the society of
  the contemporary poets, and was acquainted with Horace and saw Virgil,
  though the latter died when Ovid was yet too young and undistinguished
  to have formed his acquaintance. Ovid spent an easy life at Rome in
  the enjoyment of a competent income. He was intimate with the family
  of Augustus, the emperor, and it is supposed that some serious offence
  given to some member of that family was the cause of an event which
  reversed the poet's happy circumstances and clouded all the latter
  portion of his life. At the age of fifty he was banished from Rome,
  and ordered to betake himself to Tomi, on the borders of the Black
  Sea. Here, among the barbarous people and in a severe climate, the
  poet, who had been accustomed to all the pleasures of a luxurious
  capital and the society of his most distinguished contemporaries,
  spent the last ten years of his life, worn out with grief and anxiety.
  His only consolation in exile was to address his wife and absent
  friends, and his letters were all poetical. Though these poems (the
  "Tristia" and "Letters from Pontus") have no other topic than the
  poet's sorrow's, his exquisite taste and fruitful invention have
  redeemed them from the charge of being tedious, and they are read with
  pleasure and even with sympathy.
  The two great works of Ovid are his "Metamorphoses" and his "Fasti."
  They are both mythological poems, and from the former we have taken
  most of our stories of Grecian and Roman mythology. A late writer thus
  characterizes these poems:
  "The rich mythology of Greece furnished Ovid, as it may still
  furnish the poet, the painter, and the sculptor, with materials for
  his art. With exquisite taste, simplicity, and pathos he has
  narrated the fabulous traditions of early ages, and given to them that
  appearance of reality which only a master-hand could impart. His
  pictures of nature are striking and true; he selects with care that
  which is appropriate; he rejects the superfluous; and when he has
  completed his work, it is neither defective nor redundant. The
  'Metamorphoses' are read with pleasure by youth, and are re-read in
  more advanced age with still greater delight. The poet ventured to
  predict that his poem would survive him, and be read wherever the
  Roman name was known."
  The prediction above alluded to is contained in the closing lines of
  the "Metamorphoses," of which we give a literal translation below:

  "And now I close my work, which not the ire
  Of Jove, nor tooth of time, nor sword, nor fire
  Shall bring to nought. Come when it will that day
  Which o'er the body, not the mind, has sway,
  And snatch the remnant of my life away,
  My better part above the stars shall soar,
  And my renown endure for evermore.
  Where'er the Roman arms and arts shall spread,
  There by the people shall my book be read;
  And, if aught true in poet's visions be,
  My name and fame have immortality."
