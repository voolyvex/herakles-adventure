APOLLO AND HYACINTHUS
  Apollo was passionately fond of a youth named Hyacinthus. He.
  accompanied him in his sports, carried the nets when he went
  fishing, led the dogs when he went to hunt, followed him in his
  excursions in the mountains, and neglected for him his lyre and his
  arrows. One day they played a game of quoits together, and Apollo,
  heaving aloft the discus, with strength mingled with skill, sent it
  high and far. Hyacinthus watched it as it flew, and excited with the
  sport ran forward to seize it, eager to make his throw, when the quoit
  bounded from the earth and struck him in the forehead. He fainted
  and fell. The god, as pale as himself, raised him and tried all his
  art to stanch the wound and retain the flitting life, but all in vain;
  the hurt was past the power of medicine. As when one has broken the
  stem of a lily in the garden it hangs its head and turns its flowers
  to the earth, so the head of the dying boy, as if too heavy for his
  neck, fell over on his shoulder. "Thou diest, Hyacinth," so spoke
  Phoebus, "robbed of thy youth by me. Thine is the suffering, mine
  the crime. Would that I could die for thee! But since that may not be,
  thou shalt live with me in memory and in song. My lyre shall celebrate
  thee, my song shall tell thy fate, and thou shalt become a flower
  inscribed with my regrets." While Apollo spoke, behold the blood which
  had flowed on the ground and stained the herbage ceased to be blood;
  but a flower of hue more beautiful than the Tyrian sprang up,
  resembling the lily, if it were not that this is purple and that
  silvery white.* And this was not enough for Phoebus; but to confer
  still greater honour, he marked the petals with his sorrow, and
  inscribed "Ah! ah!" upon them, as we see to this day. The flower bears
  the name of Hyacinthus, and with every returning spring revives the
  memory of his fate.

  * It is evidently not our modern hyacinth that is here described. It
  is perhaps some species of iris, or perhaps of larkspur or pansy.

  It was said that Zephyrus (the West wind), who was also fond of
  Hyacinthus and jealous of his preference of Apollo, blew the quoit out
  of its course to make it strike Hyacinthus. Keats alludes to this in
  his "Endymion," where he describes the lookers-on at the game of
  quoits:

  "Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent
  On either side, pitying the sad death
  Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath
  Of Zephyr slew him; Zephyr penitent,
  Who now ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,
  Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain."

  An allusion to Hyacinthus will also be recognized in Milton's
  "Lycidas":

  "Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe."
