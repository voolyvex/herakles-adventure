MODERN MONSTERS
  THERE is a set of imaginary beings which seem to have been the
  successors of the "Gorgons, Hydras, and Chimeras dire" of the old
  superstitions, and, having no connection with the false gods of
  Paganism, to have continued to enjoy an existence in the popular
  belief after Paganism was superseded by Christianity. They are
  mentioned perhaps by the classical writers, but their chief popularity
  and currency seem to have been in more modern times. We seek our
  accounts of them not so much in the poetry of the ancients as in the
  old natural history books and narrations of travellers. The accounts
  which we are about to give are taken chiefly from the Penny
  Cyclopedia.
