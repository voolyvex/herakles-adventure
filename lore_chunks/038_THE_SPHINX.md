THE SPHINX
  Laius, king of Thebes, was warned by an oracle that there was danger
  to his throne and life if his new-born son should be suffered to
  grow up. He therefore committed the child to the care of a herdsman
  with orders to destroy him; but the herdsman, moved with pity, yet not
  daring entirely to disobey, tied up the child by the feet and left him
  hanging to the branch of a tree. In this condition the infant was
  found by a peasant, who carried him to his master and mistress, by
  whom he was adopted and called OEdipus, or Swollen-foot.
  Many years afterwards Laius being on his way to Delphi,
  accompanied only by one attendant, met in a narrow road a young man
  also driving in a chariot. On his refusal to leave the way at their
  command the attendant killed one of his horses, and the stranger,
  filled with rage, slew both Laius and his attendant. The young man was
  OEdipus who thus unknowingly became the slayer of his own father.
  Shortly after this event the city of Thebes was afflicted with a
  monster which infested the highroad. It was called the Sphinx. It
  had the body of a lion and the upper part of a woman. It lay
  crouched on the top of a rock, and arrested all travellers who came
  that way, proposing to them a riddle, with the condition that those
  who could solve it should pass safe, but those who failed should be
  killed. Not one had yet succeeded in solving it, and all had been
  slain. OEdipus was not daunted by these alarming accounts, but
  boldly advanced to the trial. The Sphinx asked him, "What animal is
  that which in the morning goes on feet, at noon on two, and in the
  evening upon three?" Oedipus replied, "Man, who in childhood creeps on
  hands and knees, in manhood walks erect, and in old age with the aid
  of a staff." The Sphinx was so mortified at the solving of her
  riddle that she cast herself down from the rock and perished.
  The gratitude of the people for their deliverance was so great
  that they made OEdipus their king, giving him in marriage their
  queen Jocasta. OEdipus, ignorant of his parentage, had already
  become the slayer of his father; in marrying the queen he became the
  husband of his mother. These horrors remained undiscovered, till at
  length Thebes was afflicted with famine and pestilence, and the oracle
  being consulted, the double crime of Oedipus came to light. Jocasta
  put an end to her own life, and Oedipus, seized with madness, tore out
  his eyes and wandered away from Thebes, dreaded and abandoned by all
  except his daughters, who faithfully adhered to him, till after a
  tedious period of miserable wandering he found the termination of
  his wretched life.
