MUSAEUS
  A semi-mythological personage who was represented by one tradition
  to be the son of Orpheus. He is said to have written sacred poems
  and oracles. Milton couples his name with that of Orpheus in his "Il
  Penseroso":

  "But O, sad virgin, that thy power
  Might raise Musaeus from his bower,
  Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing
  Such notes as warbled to the string,
  Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek,
  And made Hell grant what love did seek."
