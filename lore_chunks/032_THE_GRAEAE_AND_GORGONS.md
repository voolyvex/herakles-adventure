THE GRAEAE AND GORGONS
  THE Graeae were three sisters who were gray-haired from their birth,
  whence their name. The Gorgons were monstrous females with huge
  teeth like those of swine, brazen claws, and snaky hair. None of these
  beings make much figure in mythology except Medusa, the Gorgon,
  whose story we shall next advert to. We mention them chiefly to
  introduce an ingenious theory of some modern writers, namely, that the
  Gorgons and Graeae were only personifications of the terrors of the
  sea, the former denoting the strong billows of the wide open main, and
  the latter the white-crested waves that dash against the rocks of
  the coast. Their names in Greek signify the above epithets.
