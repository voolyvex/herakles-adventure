MEZENTIUS
  AEneas, with his Etrurian allies, arrived on the scene of action
  in time to rescue his beleaguered camp; and now the two armies being
  nearly equal in strength, the war began in good earnest. We cannot
  find space for all the details, but must simply record the fate of the
  principal characters whom we have introduced to our readers. The
  tyrant Mezentius, finding himself engaged against his revolting
  subjects, raged like a wild beast. He slew all who dared to
  withstand him, and put the multitude to flight wherever he appeared.
  At last he encountered AEneas, and the armies stood still to see the
  issue. Mezentius threw his spear, which striking AEneas's shield
  glanced off and hit Anthor. He was a Grecian by birth, who had left
  Argos, his native city, and followed Evander into Italy. The poet says
  of him with simple pathos which has made the words proverbial, "He
  fell, unhappy, by a wound intended for another, looked up to the
  skies, and dying remembered sweet Argos."* AEneas now in turn hurled
  his lance. It pierced the shield of Mezentius, and wounded him in
  the thigh. Lausus, his son, could not bear the sight, but rushed
  forward and interposed himself, while the followers pressed round
  Mezentius and bore him away. AEneas held his sword suspended over
  Lausus and delayed to strike, but the furious youth pressed on and
  he was compelled to deal the fatal blow. Lausus fell, and AEneas
  bent over him in pity. "Hapless youth," he said, "what can I do for
  you worthy of your praise? Keep those arms in which you glory, and
  fear not but that your body shall be restored to your friends, and
  have due funeral honours." So saying, he called the timid followers
  and delivered the body into their hands.

  Mezentius meanwhile had been borne to the river-side, and washed his
  wound. Soon the news reached him of Lausus's death, and rage and
  despair supplied the place of strength. He mounted his horse and
  dashed into the place of the fight, seeking AEneas. Having found
  him, he rode round him in a circle, throwing one javelin after
  another, while AEneas stood fenced with his shield, turning every
  way to meet them. At last, after Mezentius had three times made the
  circuit, AEneas threw his lance directly at the horse's head. It
  pierced his temples and he fell, while a shout from both armies rent
  the skies. Mezentius asked no mercy, but only that his body might be
  spared the insults of his revolted subjects, and be buried in the same
  grave with his son. He received the fatal stroke not unprepared, and
  poured out his life and his blood together.
