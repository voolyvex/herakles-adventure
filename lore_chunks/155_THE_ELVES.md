THE ELVES
  The Edda mentions another class of beings, inferior to the gods, but
  still possessed of great power; these were called Elves. The white
  spirits, or Elves of Light, were exceedingly fair, more brilliant than
  the sun, and clad in garments of a delicate and transparent texture.
  They loved the light, were kindly disposed to mankind, and generally
  appeared as fair and lovely children. Their country was called
  Alfheim, and was the domain of Freyr, the god of the sun, in whose
  light they were always sporting.
  The black or Night Elves were a different kind of creatures. Ugly,
  long-nosed dwarfs, of a dirty brown colour, they appeared only at
  night, for they avoided the sun as their most deadly enemy, because
  whenever his beams fell upon any of them they changed them immediately
  into stones. Their language was the echo of solitudes, and their
  dwelling-places subterranean caves and clefts. They were supposed to
  have come into existence as maggots produced by the decaying flesh
  of Ymir's body, and were afterwards endowed by the gods with a human
  form and great understanding. They were particularly distinguished for
  a knowledge of the mysterious powers of nature, and for the runes
  which they carved and explained. They were the most skilful artificers
  of all created beings, and worked in metals and in wood. Among their
  most noted works were Thor's hammer, and the ship "Skidbladnir," which
  they gave to Freyr, and which was so large that it could contain all
  the deities with their war and household implements, but so
  skilfully was it wrought that when folded together it could be put
  into a side pocket.
