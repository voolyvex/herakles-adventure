NISUS AND SCYLLA
  MINOS, king of Crete, made war upon Megara. Nisus was king of
  Megara, and Scylla was his daughter. The siege had now lasted six
  months and the city still held out, for it was decreed by fate that it
  should not be taken so long as a certain purple lock, which
  glittered among the hair of King Nisus, remained on his head. There
  was a tower on the city walls, which overlooked the plain where
  Minos and his army were encamped. To this tower Scylla used to repair,
  and look abroad over the tents of the hostile army. The siege had
  lasted so long that she had learned to distinguish the persons of
  the leaders. Minos, in particular, excited her admiration. Arrayed
  in his helmet, and bearing his shield, she admired his graceful
  deportment; if he threw his javelin skill seemed combined with force
  in the discharge; if he drew his bow Apollo himself could not have
  done it more gracefully. But when he laid aside his helmet, and in his
  purple robes bestrode his white horse with its gay caparisons, and
  reined in its foaming mouth, the daughter of Nisus was hardly mistress
  of herself; she was almost frantic with admiration. She envied the
  weapon that he grasped, the reins that he held. She felt as if she
  could, if it were possible, go to him through the hostile ranks; she
  felt an impulse to cast herself down from the tower into the midst
  of his camp, or to open the gates to him, or to do anything else, so
  only it might gratify Minos. As she sat in the tower, she talked
  thus with herself: "I know not whether to rejoice or grieve at this
  sad war. I grieve that Minos is our enemy; but I rejoice at any
  cause that brings him to my sight. Perhaps he would be willing to
  grant us peace, and receive me as a hostage. I would fly down, if I
  could, and alight in his camp, and tell him that we yield ourselves to
  his mercy. But then, to betray my father! No! rather would I never see
  Minos again. And yet no doubt it is sometimes the best thing for a
  city to be conquered, when the conqueror is clement and generous.
  Minos certainly has right on his side. I think we shall be
  conquered; and if that must be the end of it, why should not love
  unbar the gates to him, instead of leaving it to be done by war?
  Better spare delay and slaughter if we can. And O if any one should
  wound or kill Minos! No one surely would have the heart to do it;
  yet ignorantly, not knowing him, one might. I will, I will surrender
  myself to him, with my country as a dowry, and so put an end to the
  war. But how? The gates are guarded, and my father keeps the keys;
  he only stands in my way. O that it might please the gods to take
  him away! But why ask the gods to do it? Another woman, loving as I
  do, would remove with her own hands whatever stood in the way of her
  love. And can any other woman dare more than I? I would encounter fire
  and sword to gain my object; but here there is no need of fire and
  sword. I only need my father's purple lock. More precious than gold to
  me, that will give me all I wish."
  While she thus reasoned night came on, and soon the whole palace was
  buried in sleep. She entered her father's bedchamber and cut off the
  fatal lock; then passed out of the city and entered the enemy's
  camp. She demanded to be led to the king, and thus addressed him: "I
  am Scylla, the daughter of Nisus. I surrender to you my country and my
  father's house. I ask no reward but yourself: for love of you I have
  done it. See here the purple lock! With this I give you my father
  and his kingdom." She held out her hand with the fatal spoil. Minos
  shrunk back and refused to touch it. "The gods destroy thee,
  infamous woman," he exclaimed; "disgrace of our time! May neither
  earth nor sea yield thee a resting-place! Surely, my Crete, where Jove
  himself was cradled, shall not be polluted with such a monster!"
  Thus he said, and gave orders that equitable terms should be allowed
  to the conquered city, and that the fleet should immediately sail from
  the island.
  Scylla was frantic. "Ungrateful man," she exclaimed, "is it thus you
  leave me?- me who have given you victory,- who have sacrificed for you
  parent and country! I am guilty, I confess, and deserve to die, but
  not by your hand." As the ships left the shore, she leaped into the
  water, and seizing the rudder of the one which carried Minos, she
  was borne along an unwelcome companion of their course. A sea-eagle
  soaring aloft,- it was her father who had been changed into that
  form,- seeing her, pounced down upon her, and struck her with his beak
  and claws. In terror she let go the ship and would have fallen into
  the water, but some pitying deity changed her into a bird. The
  sea-eagle still cherishes the old animosity; and whenever he espies
  her in his lofty flight you may see him dart down upon her, with
  beak and claws, to take vengeance for the ancient crime.
