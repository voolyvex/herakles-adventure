THE APOLLO BELVEDERE
  The most highly esteemed of all the remains of ancient sculpture
  is the statue of Apollo, called the Belvedere, from the name of the
  apartment of the Pope's palace at Rome in which it was placed. The
  artist is unknown. It is supposed to be a work of Roman art, of
  about the first century of our era. It is a standing figure, in
  marble, more than seven feet high, naked except for the cloak which is
  fastened around the neck and hangs over the extended left arm. It is
  supposed to represent the god in the moment when he has shot the arrow
  to destroy the monster Python. (See Chapter III.) The victorious
  divinity is in the act of stepping forward. The left arm, which
  seems to have held the bow, is outstretched, and the head is turned in
  the same direction. In attitude and proportion the graceful majesty of
  the figure is unsurpassed. The effect is completed by the countenance,
  where on the perfection of youthful godlike beauty there dwells the
  consciousness of triumphant power.
