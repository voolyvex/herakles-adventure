BEOWULF
  ALTHOUGH the manuscript which contains the epic of Beowulf was
  written about 1000 A.D., the poem itself was known and had been
  elaborated upon for centuries by minstrels who recited the heroic
  exploits of the son of Ecgtheow and nephew of Hygelac, King of the
  Geats, whose kingdom was what is now Southern Sweden.
  In his boyhood Beowulf gave evidence of the great feats of
  strength and courage which in manhood made him the deliverer of
  Hrothgar, King of Denmark, from the monster, Grendel, and later in his
  own kingdom from the fiery dragon which dealt Beowulf a mortal blow.
  Beowulf's first renown followed his conquest of many sea-monsters
  while he swam for seven days and nights before he came to the
  country of the Finns. Helping to defend the land of the Hetware, he
  killed many of the enemy and again showed his prowess as a swimmer
  by bringing to his ship the armor of thirty of his slain pursuers.
  Offered the crown of his native land, Beowulf, just entering
  manhood, refused it in favor of Heardred, the young son of the
  queen. Instead, he acted as guardian and counsellor until the boy-king
  grew old enough to rule alone.
  For twelve years, Hrothgar, King of Denmark, suffered while his
  kingdom was being ravaged by a devouring monster, named Grendel.
  This Grendel bore a charmed life against all weapons forged by man. He
  lived in the wastelands and nightly prowled out to visit the hall of
  Hrothgar, carrying off and slaughtering many of the guests.
  Beowulf, hearing from mariners of Grendel's murderous visits, sailed
  from Geatland with fourteen stalwart companions to render Hrothgar the
  help of his great strength. Landing on the Danish coast, Beowulf was
  challenged as a spy. He persuaded the coastguards to let him pass, and
  he was received and feasted by King Hrothgar. When the king and his
  court retired for the night, Beowulf and his companions were left
  alone in the hall. All but Beowulf fell asleep. Grendel entered.
  With a stroke he killed one of Beowulf's sleeping men, but Beowulf,
  unarmed, wrestled with the monster and by dint of his great strength
  managed to tear Grendel's arm out at the shoulder. Grendel, mortally
  wounded, retreated, leaving a bloody trail from the hall to his lair.
  All fear of another attack by Grendel allayed. the Danes returned to
  the hall, and Beowulf and his companions were sheltered elsewhere.
  Grendel's mother came to avenge the fatal injury to her monster son
  and carried off a Danish nobleman and Grendel's torn-off paw.
  Following the blood trail, Beowulf went forth to despatch the
  mother. Armed with his sword, Hrunting, he came to the water's edge.
  He plunged in and swam to a chamber under the sea. There he fought
  with Grendel's mother, killing her with an old sword he found in the
  sea cavern. Nearby was Grendel's body. Beowulf cut off its head and
  brought it back as a trophy to King Hrothgar. Great was the
  rejoicing in the hall and greater was Beowulf's welcome when he
  returned to Geatland, where he was given great estates and many high
  honors.
  Shortly afterward, Heardred, the boy-king, was killed in the war
  with the Swedes. Beowulf succeeded him to the throne.
  For fifty years Beowulf ruled his people in peace and serenity. Then
  suddenly a dragon, furious at having his treasure stolen from his
  hoard in a burial mound, began to ravage Beowulf's kingdom. Like
  Grendel, this monster left its den at night on its errand of murder
  and pillage.
  Beowulf, now an aged monarch, resolved to do battle, unaided, with
  the dragon. He approached the entrance to its den, whence boiling
  steam issued forth. Undaunted, Beowulf strode forward shouting his
  defiance. The dragon came out, sputtering flames from its mouth. The
  monster rushed upon Beowulf with all its fury and almost crushed him
  in its first charge. So fearful grew the struggle that all but one
  of Beowulf's men deserted and fled for their lives. Wiglaf remained to
  help his aged monarch. Another rush of the dragon shattered
  Beowulf's sword and the monster's fangs sunk into Beowulf's neck.
  Wiglaf, rushing into the struggle, helped the dying Beowulf to kill
  the dragon.
  Before his death, Beowulf named Wiglaf his successor to the throne
  of Geatland and ordered that his own ashes be placed in a memorial
  shrine at the top of a high cliff commanding the sea. Beowulf's body
  was burned on a vast funeral pyre, while twelve Geats rode around
  the mound singing their sorrow and their praise for the good and great
  man, Beowulf.
