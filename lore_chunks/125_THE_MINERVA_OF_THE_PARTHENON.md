THE MINERVA OF THE PARTHENON
  This was also the work of Phidias. It stood in the Parthenon, or
  temple of Minerva at Athens. The goddess was represented standing.
  In one hand she held a spear, in the other a statue of Victory. Her
  helmet, highly decorated, was surmounted by a Sphinx. The statue was
  forty feet in height, and, like the Jupiter, composed of ivory and
  gold. The eyes were of marble, and probably painted to represent the
  iris and pupil. The Parthenon, in which this statue stood, was also
  constructed under the direction and superintendence of Phidias. Its
  exterior was enriched with sculptures, many of them from the hand of
  Phidias. The Elgin marbles, now in the British Museum, are a part of
  them.
  Both the Jupiter and Minerva of Phidias are lost, but there is
  good ground to believe that we have, in several extant statues and
  busts, the artist's conceptions of the countenances of both. They
  are characterized by grave and dignified beauty, and freedom from
  any transient expression, which in the language of art is called
  repose.
