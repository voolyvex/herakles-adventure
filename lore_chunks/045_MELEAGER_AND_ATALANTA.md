MELEAGER AND ATALANTA
  ONE of the heroes of the Argonautic expedition was Meleager, son
  of OEneus and Althea, king and queen of Calydon. Althea, when her
  son was born, beheld the three destinies, who as they spun their fatal
  thread, foretold that the life of the child should last no longer than
  a brand then burning upon the hearth. Althea seized and quenched the
  brand, and carefully preserved it for years, while Meleager grew to
  boyhood, youth and manhood. It chanced, then, that OEneus, as he
  offered sacrifices to the gods, omitted to pay due honours to Diana;
  and she, indignant at the neglect, sent a wild boar of enormous size
  to lay waste the fields of Calydon. Its eyes shone with blood and
  fire, its bristles stood like threatening spears, its tusks were
  like those of Indian elephants. The growing corn was trampled, the
  vines and olive trees laid waste, the flocks and herds were driven
  in wild confusion by the slaughtering foe. All common aid seemed vain;
  but Meleager called on the heroes of Greece to join in a bold hunt for
  the ravenous monster. Theseus and his friend Pirithous, Jason, Peleus,
  afterwards the father of Achilles, Telamon the father of Ajax, Nestor,
  then a youth, but who in his age bore arms with Achilles and Ajax in
  the Trojan war- these and many more joined in the enterprise. With
  them came Atalanta, the daughter of Iasius, king of Arcadia. A
  buckle of polished gold confined her vest, an ivory quiver hung on her
  left shoulder, and her left hand bore the bow. Her face blent feminine
  beauty with the best graces of martial youth. Meleager saw and loved.
  But now already they were near the monster's lair. They stretched
  strong nets from tree to tree; they uncoupled their dogs, they tried
  to find the footprints of their quarry in the grass. From the wood was
  a descent to marshy grounds. Here the boar, as he lay among the reeds,
  heard the shouts of his pursuers, and rushed forth against them. One
  and another is thrown down and slain. Jason throws his spear, with a
  prayer to Diana for success; and the favouring goddess allows the
  weapon to touch, but not to wound, removing the steel point of the
  spear in its flight. Nestor, assailed, seeks and finds safety in the
  branches of a tree. Telamon rushes on, but stumbling at a projecting
  root, falls prone. But an arrow from Atalanta at length for the
  first time tastes the monster's blood. It is a slight wound, but
  Meleager sees and joyfully proclaims it. Anceus, excited to envy by
  the praise given to a female, loudly Proclaims his own valour, and
  defies alike the boar and the goddess who had sent it; but as he
  rushes on, the infuriated beast lays him low with a mortal wound.
  Theseus throws his lance, but it is turned aside by a projecting
  bough. The dart of Jason misses its object, and kills instead one of
  their own dogs. But Meleager, after one unsuccessful stroke, drives
  his spear into the monster's side, then rushes on and despatches him
  with repeated blows.
  Then rose a shout from those around; they congratulated the
  conqueror, crowding to touch his hand. He, placing his foot upon the
  head of the slain boar, turned to Atalanta and bestowed on her the
  head and the rough hide which were the trophies of his success. But at
  this, envy excited the rest to strife. Plexippus and Toxeus, the
  brothers of Meleager's mother, beyond the rest opposed the gift, and
  snatched from the maiden the trophy she had received. Meleager,
  kindling with rage at the wrong done to himself, and still more at the
  insult offered to her whom he loved, forgot the claims of kindred, and
  plunged his sword into the offenders' hearts.
  As Althea bore gifts of thankfulness to the temples for the
  victory of her son, the bodies of her murdered brothers met her sight.
  She shrieks, and beats her breast, and hastens to change the
  garments of rejoicing for those of mourning. But when the author of
  the deed is known, grief gives way to the stern desire of vengeance on
  her son. The fatal brand, which once she rescued from the flames,
  the brand which the destinies had linked with Meleager's life, she
  brings forth, and commands a fire to be prepared. Then four times
  she essays to place the brand upon the pile; four times draws back,
  shuddering at the thought of bringing destruction on her son. The
  feelings of the mother and the sister contend within her. Now she is
  pale at the thought of the proposed deed, now flushed again with anger
  at the act of her son. As a vessel, driven in one direction by the
  wind, and in the opposite by the tide, the mind of Althea hangs
  suspended in uncertainty. But now the sister prevails above the
  mother, and she begins as she holds the fatal wood: "Turn, ye
  Furies, goddesses of punishment! turn to behold the sacrifice I bring!
  Crime must atone for crime. Shall OEneus rejoice in his victor son,
  while the house of Thestius is desolate? But, alas! to what deed am
  I borne along? Brothers, forgive a mother's weakness! my hand fails
  me. He deserves death, but not that I should destroy him. But shall he
  then live, and triumph, and reign over Calydon, while you, my
  brothers, wander unavenged among the shades? No! thou hast lived by my
  gift; die, now, for thine own crime. Return the life which twice I
  gave thee, first at thy birth, again when I snatched this brand from
  the flames. O that thou hadst then died! Alas! evil is the conquest;
  but, brothers, ye have conquered." And, turning away her face, she
  threw the fatal wood upon the burning pile.
  It gave, or seemed to give, a deadly groan. Meleager, absent and
  unknowing of the cause, felt a sudden pang. He burns, and only by
  courageous pride conquers the pain which destroys him. He mourns
  only that he perishes by a bloodless and unhonoured death. With his
  last breath he calls upon his aged father, his brother, and his fond
  sisters, upon his beloved Atalanta, and upon his mother, the unknown
  cause of his fate. The flames increase, and with them the pain of
  the hero. Now both subside; now both are quenched. The brand is ashes,
  and the life of Meleager is breathed forth to the wandering winds.
  Althea, when the deed was done, laid violent hands upon herself. The
  sisters of Meleager mourned their brother with uncontrollable grief;
  till Diana, pitying the sorrows of the house that once had aroused her
  anger, turned them into birds.
