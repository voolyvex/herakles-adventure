THE SEA-MONSTER
  Perseus, continuing his flight, arrived at the country of the
  AEthiopians, of which Cepheus was king. Cassiopeia his queen, proud of
  her beauty, had dared to compare herself to the Sea-nymphs, which
  roused their indignation to such a degree that they sent a
  prodigious sea-monster to ravage the coast. To appease the deities,
  Cepheus was directed by the oracle to expose his daughter Andromeda to
  be devoured by the monster. As Perseus looked down from his aerial
  height he beheld the virgin chained to a rock, and waiting the
  approach of the serpent. She was so pale and motionless that if it had
  not been for her flowing tears and her hair that moved in the
  breeze, he would have taken her for a marble statue. He was so
  startled at the sight that he almost forgot to wave his wings. As he
  hovered over her he said, "O virgin, undeserving of those chains,
  but rather of such as bind fond lovers together, tell me, I beseech
  you, your name, and the name of your country, and why you are thus
  bound." At first she was silent from modesty, and, if she could, would
  have hid her face with her hands; but when he repeated his
  questions, for fear she might be thought guilty of some fault which
  she dared not tell, she disclosed her name And that of her country,
  and her mother's pride of beauty. Before she had done speaking, a
  sound was heard off upon the water, and the sea-monster appeared, with
  his head raised above the surface, cleaving the waves with his broad
  breast. The virgin shrieked, the father and mother who had now arrived
  at the scene, wretched both, but the mother more justly so, stood
  by, not able to afford protection, but only to pour forth lamentations
  and to embrace the victim. Then spoke Perseus; "There will be time
  enough for tears; this hour is all we have for rescue. My rank as
  the son of Jove and my renown as the slayer of the Gorgon might make
  me acceptable as a suitor; but I will try to win her by services
  rendered, if the gods will only be propitious. If she be rescued by my
  valour, I demand that she be my reward." The parents consent (how
  could they hesitate?) and promise a royal dowry with her.
  And now the monster was within the range of a stone thrown by a
  skilful slinger, when with a sudden bound the youth soared into the
  air. As an eagle, when from his lofty flight he sees a serpent basking
  in the sun, pounces upon him and seizes him by the neck to prevent him
  from turning his head round and using his fangs, so the youth darted
  down upon the back of the monster and plunged his sword into its
  shoulder. Irritated by the wound, the monster raised himself into
  the air, then plunged into the depth; then, like a wild boar
  surrounded by a pack of barking dogs, turned swiftly from side to
  side, while the youth eluded its attacks by means of his wings.
  Wherever he can find a passage for his sword between the scales he
  makes a wound, piercing now the side, now the flank, as it slopes
  towards the tail. The brute spouts from his nostrils water mixed
  with blood. The wings of the hero are wet with it, and he dares no
  longer trust to them. Alighting on a rock which rose above the
  waves, and holding on by a projecting fragment, as the monster floated
  near he gave him a death stroke. The people who had gathered on the
  shore shouted so that the hills reechoed with the sound. The
  parents, transported with joy, embraced their future son-in-law,
  calling him their deliverer and the saviour of their house, and the
  virgin, both cause and reward of the contest, descended from the rock.

  Cassiopeia was an AEthiopian, and consequently, in spite of her
  boasted beauty, black; at least so Milton seems to have thought, who
  alludes to this story in his "Penseroso," where he addresses
  Melancholy as the

  "...goddess, sage and holy,
  Whose saintly visage is too bright
  To hit the sense of human sight,
  And, therefore, to our weaker view,
  O'erlaid with black, staid Wisdom's hue.
  Black, but such as in esteem
  Prince Memnon's sister might beseem.
  Or that starred AEthiop queen that strove
  To set her beauty's praise above
  The sea-nymphs, and their powers offended."

  Cassiopeia is called "the starred AEthiop, queen" because after
  her death she was placed among the stars, forming the constellation of
  that name. Though she attained this honour, yet the Sea-Nymphs, her
  old enemies, prevailed so far as to cause her to be placed in that
  part of the heaven near the pole, where every night she is half the
  time held with her head downward, to give her a lesson of humility.
  Memnon was an AEthiopian prince, of whom we shall tell in a future
  chapter.
