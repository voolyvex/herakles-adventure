ENDYMION
  ENDYMION was a beautiful youth who fed his flock on Mount Latmos.
  One calm, clear night Diana, the moon, looked down and saw him
  sleeping. The cold heart of the virgin goddess was warmed by his
  surpassing beauty, and she came down to him, kissed him, and watched
  over him while he slept.
  Another story was that Jupiter bestowed on him the gift of perpetual
  youth united with perpetual sleep. Of one so gifted we can have but
  few adventures to record. Diana, it was said, took care that his
  fortunes should not suffer by his inactive life, for she made his
  flock increase, and guarded his sheep and lambs from the wild beasts.
  The story of Endymion has a peculiar charm from the human meaning
  which it so thinly veils. We see in Endymion the young poet, his fancy
  and his heart seeking in vain for that which can satisfy them, finding
  his favourite hour in the quiet moonlight, and nursing there beneath
  the beams of the bright and silent witness the melancholy and the
  ardour which consume him. The story suggests aspiring and poetic love,
  a life spent more in dreams than in reality, and an early and
  welcome death.- S. G. B.

  The "Endymion" of Keats is a wild and fanciful poem, containing some
  exquisite poetry, as this, to the moon:

  "...The sleeping kine
  Couched in thy brightness dream of fields divine.
  Innumerable mountains rise, and rise,
  Ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes,
  And yet thy benediction passeth not
  One obscure hiding-place, one little spot
  Where pleasure may be sent; the nested wren
  Has thy fair face within its tranquil ken;" etc., etc.

  Dr. Young, in the "Night Thoughts," alludes to Endymion thus:

  "...These thoughts, O Night, are thine;
  From thee they came like lovers' secret sighs,
  While others slept. So Cynthia, poets feign,
  In shadows veiled, soft, sliding from her sphere,
  Her shepherd cheered, of her enamoured less
  Than I of thee."

  Fletcher, in the "Faithful Shepherdess," tells:

  "How the pale Phoebe, hunting in a grove,
  First saw the boy Endymion, from whose eyes
  She took eternal fire that never dies;
  How she conveyed him softly in a sleep,
  His temples bound with poppy, to the steep
  Head of old Latmos, where she stoops each night,
  Gilding the mountain with her brother's light,
  To kiss her sweetest."
