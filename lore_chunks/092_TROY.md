TROY
  After hearing so much about the city of Troy and its heroes, the
  reader will perhaps be surprised to learn that the exact site of
  that famous city is still a matter of dispute. There are some vestiges
  of tombs on the plain which most nearly answers to the description
  given by Homer and the ancient geographers, but no other evidence of
  the former existence of a great city. Byron thus describes the present
  appearance of the scene:

  "The winds are high, and Helle's tide
  Rolls darkly heaving to the main;
  And night's descending shadows hide
  That field with blood bedewed in vain,
  The desert of old Priam's pride,
  The tombs, sole relics of his reign.
  All- save immortal dreams that could beguile
  The blind old man of Scio's rocky isle."
  Bride of Abydos.
