THE POETS OF MYTHOLOGY
  Homer, from whose poems of the "Iliad" and "Odyssey" we have taken
  the chief part of our chapters of the Trojan war and the return of the
  Grecians, is almost as mythical a personage as the heroes he
  celebrates. The traditionary story is that he was a wandering
  minstrel, blind and old, who travelled from place to place singing his
  lays to the music of his harp, in the courts of princes or the
  cottages of peasants, and dependent upon the voluntary offerings of
  his hearers for support. Byron calls him "The blind old man of
  Scio's rocky isle," and a well-known epigram, alluding to the
  uncertainty of the fact of his birthplace, says:

  "Seven wealthy towns contend for Homer dead,
  Through which the living Homer begged his bread."

  These seven were Smyrna, Scio, Rhodes, Colophon, Salamis, Argos, and
  Athens.
  Modern scholars have doubted whether the Homeric poems are the
  work of any single mind. This arises from the difficulty of
  believing that poems of such length could have been committed to
  writing at so early an age as that usually assigned to these, an age
  earlier than the date of any remaining inscriptions or coins, and when
  no materials capable of containing such long productions were yet
  introduced into use. On the other hand it is asked how poems of such
  length could have been handed down from age to age by means of the
  memory alone. This is answered by the statement that there was a
  professional body of men, called Rhapsodists, who recited the poems of
  others, and whose business it was to commit to memory and rehearse for
  pay the national and patriotic legends.
  The prevailing opinion of the learned, at this time, seems to be
  that the framework and much of the structure of the poems belongs to
  Homer, but that there are numerous interpolations and additions by
  other hands.
  The date assigned to Homer, on the authority of Herodotus, is 850
  B.C.
