ATALANTA
  The innocent cause of so much sorrow was a maiden whose face you
  might truly say was boyish for a girl, yet too girlish for a boy.
  Her fortune had been told, and it was to this effect: "Atalanta, do
  not marry; marriage will be your ruin." Terrified by this oracle,
  she fled the society of men, and devoted herself to the sports of
  the chase. To all suitors (for she had many) she imposed a condition
  which was generally effectual in relieving her of their
  persecutions- "I will be the prize of him who shall conquer me in
  the race; but death must be the penalty of all who try and fail." In
  spite of this hard condition some would try. Hippomenes was to be
  judge of the race. "Can it be possible that any will be so rash as
  to risk so much for a wife?" said he. But when he saw her lay aside
  her robe for the race, he changed his mind, and said, "Pardon me,
  youths, I knew not the prize you were competing for." As he surveyed
  them he wished them all to be beaten, and swelled with envy of any one
  that seemed at all likely to win. While such were his thoughts, the
  virgin darted forward. As she ran she looked more beautiful than ever.
  The breezes seemed to give wings to her feet; her hair flew over her
  shoulders, and the gay fringe of her garment fluttered behind her. A
  ruddy hue tinged the whiteness of her skin, such as a crimson
  curtain casts on a marble wall. All her competitors were distanced,
  and were put to death without mercy. Hippomenes, not daunted by this
  result, fixing his eyes on the virgin, said, "Why boast of beating
  those laggards? I offer myself for the contest." Atalanta looked at
  him with a pitying countenance, and hardly knew whether she would
  rather conquer him or not. "What god can tempt one so young and
  handsome to throw himself away? I pity him, not for his beauty (yet he
  is beautiful), but for his youth. I wish he would give up the race, or
  if he will be so mad, I hope he may outrun me." While she hesitates,
  revolving these thoughts, the spectators grow impatient for the
  race, and her father prompts her to prepare. Then Hippomenes addressed
  a prayer to Venus: "Help me, Venus, for you have led me on." Venus
  heard and was propitious.
  In the garden of her temple, in her own island of Cyprus, is a
  tree with yellow leaves and yellow branches and golden fruit. Hence
  she gathered three golden apples, and unseen by any one else, gave
  them to Hippomenes, and told him how to use them. The signal is given;
  each starts from the goal and skims over the sand. So light their
  tread, you would almost have thought they might run over the river
  surface or over the waving grain without sinking. The cries of the
  spectators cheered Hippomenes,- "Now, now, do your best! haste, haste!
  you gain on her! relax not! one more effort!" It was doubtful
  whether the youth or the maiden heard these cries with the greater
  pleasure. But his breath began to fail him, his throat was dry, the
  goal yet far off. At that moment be threw down one of the golden
  apples. The virgin was all amazement. She stopped to pick it up.
  Hippomenes shot ahead. Shouts burst forth from all sides. She
  redoubled her efforts, and soon overtook him. Again he threw an apple.
  She stopped again, but again came up with him. The goal was near;
  one chance only remained. "Now, goddess," said he, "prosper your
  gift!" and threw the last apple off at one side. She looked at it, and
  hesitated; Venus impelled her to turn aside for it. She did so, and
  was vanquished. The youth carried off his prize.
  But the lovers were so full of their own happiness that they
  forgot to pay due honour to Venus; and the goddess was provoked at
  their ingratitude. She caused them to give offence to Cybele. That
  powerful goddess was not to be insulted with impunity. She took from
  them their human form and turned them into animals of characters
  resembling their own: of the huntress-heroine, triumphing in the blood
  of her lovers, she made a lioness, and of her lord and master a
  lion, and yoked them to her car, where they are still to be seen in
  all representations, in statuary or painting, of the goddess Cybele.

  Cybele is the Latin name of the goddess called by the Greeks Rhea
  and Ops. She was the wife of Cronos and mother of Zeus. In works of
  art she exhibits the matronly air which distinguishes Juno and
  Ceres. Sometimes she is veiled, and seated on a throne with lions at
  her side, at other times riding in a chariot drawn by lions. She wears
  a mural crown, that is, a crown whose rim is carved in the form of
  towers and battlements. Her priests were called Corybantes.

  Byron, in describing the city of Venice, which is built on a low
  island in the Adriatic Sea, borrows an illustration from Cybele:

  "She looks a sea-Cybele fresh from ocean,
  Rising with her tiara of proud towers
  At airy distance, with majestic motion,
  A ruler of the waters and their powers."
  Childe Harold, IV.

  In Moore's "Rhymes on the Road," the poet, speaking of Alpine
  scenery, alludes to the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes thus:

  "Even here, in this region of wonders, I find
  That light-footed Fancy leaves Truth far behind,
  Or at least, like Hippomenes, turns her astray
  By the golden illusions he flings in her way."
