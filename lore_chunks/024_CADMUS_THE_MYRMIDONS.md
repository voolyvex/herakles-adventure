CADMUS- THE MYRMIDONS
  JUPITER, under the disguise of a bull, had carried away Europa,
  the daughter of Agenor, king of Phoenicia. Agenor commanded his son
  Cadmus to go in search of his sister, and not to return without her.
  Cadmus went and sought long and far for his sister, but could not find
  her, and not daring to return unsuccessful, consulted the oracle of
  Apollo to know what country he should settle in. The oracle informed
  him that he should find a cow in the field, and should follow her
  wherever she might wander, and where she stopped, should build a
  city and call it Thebes. Cadmus had hardly left the Castalian cave,
  from which the oracle was delivered, when he saw a young cow slowly
  walking before him. He followed her close, offering at the same time
  his prayers to Phoebus. The cow went on till she passed the shallow
  channel of Cephisus and came out into the plain of Panope. There she
  stood still, raising her broad forehead to the sky filled the air with
  her lowings. Cadmus gave thanks, and stooping down kissed the
  foreign soil, then lifting his eyes, greeted the surrounding
  mountains. Wishing to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter, he sent his
  servants to seek pure water for a libation. Near by there stood an
  ancient grove which had never been profaned by the axe, in the midst
  of which there was a cave, thick covered with the growth of bushes,
  its roof forming a low arch, from beneath which burst forth a fountain
  of purest water. In the cave lurked a horrid serpent with a crested
  head and scales glittering like gold. His eyes shone like fire, his
  body was swollen with venom, he vibrated a triple tongue, and showed a
  triple row of teeth. No sooner had the Tyrians dipped their pitchers
  in the fountain, and the in-gushing waters made a sound, than the
  glittering serpent raised his head out of the cave and uttered a
  fearful hiss. The vessels fell from their hands, the blood left
  their cheeks, they trembled in every limb. The serpent, twisting his
  scaly body in a huge coil, raised his head so as to overtop the
  tallest trees, and while the Tyrians from terror could neither fight
  nor fly, slew some with his fangs, others in his folds, and others
  with his poisonous breath.
  Cadmus, having waited for the return of his men till midday, went in
  search of them. His covering was a lion's hide, and besides his
  Javelin he carried in his hand a lance, and in his breast a bold
  heart, a surer reliance than either. When he entered the wood and
  saw the lifeless bodies of his men, and the monster with his bloody
  jaws, he exclaimed, "O faithful friends, I will avenge you, or share
  your death." So saying he lifted a huge stone and threw it with all
  his force at the serpent. Such a block would have shaken the wall of a
  fortress, but it made no impression on the monster. Cadmus next
  threw his javelin, which met with better success, for it penetrated
  the serpent's scales, and pierced through to his entrails. Fierce with
  pain, the monster turned back his head to view the wound, and
  attempted to draw out the weapon with his mouth, but broke it off,
  leaving the iron point rankling in his flesh. His neck swelled with
  rage, bloody foam covered his jaws, and the breath of his nostrils
  poisoned the air around. Now he twisted himself into a circle, then
  stretched himself out on the ground like the trunk of a fallen tree.
  As he moved onward, Cadmus retreated before him, holding his spear
  opposite to the monster's opened jaws. The serpent snapped at the
  weapon and attempted to bite its iron point. At last Cadmus,
  watching his chance, thrust the spear at a moment when the animal's
  head thrown back came against the trunk of a tree, and so succeeded in
  pinning him to its side. His weight bent the tree as he struggled in
  the agonies of death.
  While Cadmus stood over his conquered foe, contemplating its vast
  size, a voice was heard (from whence he knew not, but he heard it
  distinctly) commanding him to take the dragon's teeth and sow them
  in the earth. He obeyed. He made a furrow in the ground, and planted
  the teeth, destined to produce a crop of men. Scarce had he done so
  when the clods began to move, and the points of spears to appear above
  the surface. Next helmets with their nodding plumes came up, and
  next the shoulders and breasts and limbs of men with weapons, and in
  time a harvest of armed warriors. Cadmus, alarmed, prepared to
  encounter a new enemy, but one of them said to him, "Meddle not with
  our civil war." With that he who had spoken smote one of his
  earth-born brothers with a sword, and he himself fell pierced with
  an arrow from another. The latter fell victim to a fourth, and in like
  manner the whole crowd dealt with each other till all fell, slain with
  mutual wounds, except five survivors. One of these cast away his
  weapons and said, "Brothers, let us live in peace!" These five
  joined with Cadmus in building his city, to which they gave the name
  of Thebes.
  Cadmus obtained in marriage Harmonia, the daughter of Venus. The
  gods left Olympus to honour the occasion with their presence, and
  Vulcan presented the bride with a necklace of surpassing brilliancy,
  his own workmanship. But a fatality hung over the family of Cadmus
  in consequence of his killing the serpent sacred to Mars. Semele and
  Ino, his daughters, and Actaeon and Pentheus, his grandchildren, all
  perished unhappily, and Cadmus and Harmonia quitted Thebes, now
  grown odious to them, and emigrated to the country of the
  Enchelians, who received them with honour and made Cadmus their
  king. But the misfortunes of their children still weighed upon their
  minds; and one day Cadmus exclaimed, "If a serpent's life is so dear
  to the gods, I would I were myself a serpent." No sooner had he
  uttered the words than he began to change his form. Harmonia beheld it
  and prayed to the gods to let her share his fate. Both became
  serpents. They live in the woods, but mindful of their origin, they
  neither avoid the presence of man nor do they ever injure any one.

  There is a tradition that Cadmus introduced into Greece the
  letters of the alphabet which were invented by the Phoenicians. This
  is alluded to by Byron, where, addressing the modern Greeks, he says:

  "You have the letters Cadmus gave,
  Think you he meant them for a slave?"

  Milton, describing the serpent which tempted Eve, is reminded of the
  serpents of the classical stories and says:

  ..."-pleasing was his shape,
  And lovely: never since the serpent kind
  Lovelier; not those that in Illyria changed
  Hermione and Cadmus, nor the god
  In Epidaurus."
