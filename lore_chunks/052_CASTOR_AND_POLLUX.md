CASTOR AND POLLUX
  Castor and Pollux were the offspring of Leda and the Swan, under
  which disguise Jupiter had concealed himself. Leda gave, birth to an
  egg from which sprang the twins. Helen, so famous afterwards as the
  cause of the Trojan war, was their sister.
  When Theseus and his friend Pirithous had carried off Helen from
  Sparta, the youthful heroes, Castor and Pollux, with their
  followers, hastened to her rescue. Theseus was absent from Attica
  and the brothers were successful in recovering their sister.
  Castor was famous for taming and managing horses, and Pollux for
  skill in boxing. They were united by the warmest affection and
  inseparable in all their enterprises. They accompanied the
  Argonautic expedition. During the voyage a storm arose, and Orpheus
  prayed to the Samothracian gods, and played on his harp, whereupon the
  storm ceased and stars appeared on the heads of the brothers. From
  this incident, Castor and Pollux came afterwards to be considered
  the patron deities of seamen and voyagers, and the lambent flames,
  which in certain states of the atmosphere play round the sails and
  masts of vessels, were called by their names.
  After the Argonautic expedition, we find Castor and Pollux engaged
  in a war with Idas and Lynceus. Castor was slain, and Pollux,
  inconsolable for the loss of his brother, besought Jupiter to be
  permitted to give his own life as a ransom for him. Jupiter so far
  consented as to allow the two brothers to enjoy the boon of life
  alternately, passing one day under the earth and the next in the
  heavenly abodes. According to another form of the story, Jupiter
  rewarded the attachment of the brothers by placing them among the
  stars as Gemini the Twins.
  They received divine honours under the name of Dioscuri (sons of
  Jove). They were believed to have appeared occasionally in later
  times, taking part with one side or the other, in hard-fought
  fields, and were said on such occasions to be mounted on magnificent
  white steeds. Thus in the early history of Rome they are said to
  have assisted the Romans at the battle of Lake Regillus, and after the
  victory a temple was erected in their honour on the spot where they
  appeared.

  Macaulay, in his "Lays of Ancient Rome," thus alludes to the legend:

  "So like they were, no mortal
  Might one from other know;
  White as snow their armour was,
  Their steeds were white as snow.
  Never on earthly anvil
  Did such rare armour gleam,
  And never did such gallant steeds
  Drink of an earthly stream.

  "Back comes the chief in triumph
  Who in the hour of fight
  Hath seen the great twin Brethren
  In harness on his right.
  Safe comes the ship to haven,
  Through billows and through gales,
  If once the great Twin Brethren
  Sit shining on the sails."
