ORACLES
  Oracle was the name used to denote the place where answers were
  supposed to be given by any of the divinities to those who consulted
  them respecting the future. The word was also used to signify the
  response which was given.
  The most ancient Grecian oracle was that of Jupiter at Dodona.
  According to one account, it was established in the following
  manner: Two black doves took their flight from Thebes in Egypt. One
  flew to Dodona in Epirus, and alighting in a grove of oaks, it
  proclaimed in human language to the inhabitants of the district that
  they must establish there an oracle of Jupiter. The other dove flew to
  the temple of Jupiter Ammon in the Libyan Oasis, and delivered a
  similar command there. Another account is, that they were not doves,
  but priestesses, who were carried off from Thebes in Egypt by the
  Phoenicians, and set up oracles at the Oasis and Dodona. The responses
  of the oracle were given from the trees, by the branches rustling in
  the wind, the sounds being interpreted by the priests.
  But the most celebrated of the Grecian oracles was that of Apollo at
  Delphi, a city built on the slopes of Parnassus in Phocis.
  It had been observed at a very early period that the goats feeding
  on Parnassus were thrown into convulsions when they approached a
  certain long deep cleft in the side of the mountain. This was owing to
  a peculiar vapour arising out of the cavern, and one of the
  goatherds was induced to try its effects upon himself. Inhaling the
  intoxicating air, he was affected in the same manner as the cattle had
  been, and the inhabitants of the surrounding country, unable to
  explain the circumstance, imputed the convulsive ravings to which he
  gave utterance while under the power of the exhalations to a divine
  inspiration. The fact was speedily circulated widely, and a temple was
  erected on the spot. The prophetic influence was at first variously
  attributed to the goddess Earth, to Neptune, Themis, and others, but
  it was at length assigned to Apollo, and to him alone. A priestess was
  appointed whose office it was to inhale the hallowed air, and who
  was named the Pythia. She was prepared for this duty by previous
  ablution at the fountain of Castalia, and being crowned with laurel
  was seated upon a tripod similarly adorned, which was placed over
  the chasm whence the divine afflatus proceeded. Her inspired words
  while thus situated were interpreted by the priests.
