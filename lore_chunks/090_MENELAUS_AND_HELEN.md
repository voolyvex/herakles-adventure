MENELAUS AND HELEN
  Our readers will be anxious to know the fate of Helen, the fair
  but guilty occasion of so much slaughter. On the fall of Troy Menelaus
  recovered possession of his wife, who had not ceased to love him,
  though she had yielded to the might of Venus and deserted him for
  another. After the death of Paris she aided the Greeks secretly on
  several occasions, and in particular when Ulysses and Diomed entered
  the city in disguise to carry off the Palladium. She saw and
  recognized Ulysses, but kept the secret and even assisted them in
  obtaining the image. Thus she became reconciled to her husband, and
  they were among the first to leave the shores of Troy for their native
  land. But having incurred the displeasure of the gods they were driven
  by storms from shore to shore of the Mediterranean, visiting Cyprus,
  Phoenicia and Egypt. In Egypt they were kindly treated and presented
  with rich gifts, of which Helen's share was a golden spindle and a
  basket on wheels. The basket was to hold the wool and spools for the
  queen's work.

  Dyer, in his poem of the "Fleece," thus alludes to this incident:

  "...many yet adhere
  To the ancient distaff, at the bosom fixed,
  Casting the whirling spindle as they walk.

  . . . . . . . .

  This was of old, in no inglorious days,
  The mode of spinning, when the Egyptian prince
  A golden distaff gave that beauteous nymph,
  Too beauteous Helen; no uncourtly gift."

  Milton also alludes to a famous recipe for an invigorating
  draught, called Nepenthe, which the Egyptian queen gave to Helen:

  "Not that Nepenthes which the wife of Thone
  In Egypt gave to Jove-born Helena,
  Is of such power to stir up joy as this,
  To life so friendly or so cool to thirst."
  Comus.

  Menelaus and Helen at length arrived in safety at Sparta, resumed
  their royal dignity, and lived and reigned in splendour; and when
  Telemachus, the son of Ulysses, in search of his father, arrived at
  Sparta, he found Menelaus and Helen celebrating the marriage of
  their daughter Hermione to Neoptolemus, son of Achilles.
