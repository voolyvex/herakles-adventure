NORTHERN MYTHOLOGY
  THE stories which have engaged our attention thus far relate to
  the mythology of southern regions. But there is another branch of
  ancient superstitions which ought not to be entirely overlooked,
  especially as it belongs to the nations from which we, through our
  English ancestors, derive our origin. It is that of the northern
  nations, called Scandinavians, who inhabited the countries now known
  as Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. These mythological records
  are contained in two collections called the Eddas, of which the oldest
  is in poetry and dates back to the year 1O56, the more modern or prose
  Edda being of the date of 1640.
  According to the Eddas there was once no heaven above nor earth
  beneath, but only a bottomless deep, and a world of mist in which
  flowed a fountain. Twelve rivers issued from this fountain, and when
  they had flowed far from their source, they froze into ice, and one
  layer accumulating over another, the great deep was filled up.
  Southward from the world of mist was the world of light. From this
  flowed a warm wind upon the ice and melted it. The vapours rose in the
  air and formed clouds, from which sprang Ymir, the Frost giant and his
  progeny, and the cow Audhumbla, whose milk afforded nourishment and
  food to the giant. The cow got nourishment by licking the hoar frost
  and salt from the ice. While she was one day licking the salt stones
  there appeared at first the hair of a man, on the second day the whole
  head, and on the third the entire form endowed with beauty, agility,
  and power. This new being was a god, from whom and his wife, a
  daughter of the giant race, sprang the three brothers Odin, Vili,
  and Ve. They slew the giant Ymir, and out of his body formed the
  earth, of his blood the seas, of his bones the mountains, of his
  hair the trees, of his skull the heavens, and of his brain clouds,
  charged with hail and snow. Of Ymir's eyebrows the gods formed Midgard
  (mid earth), destined to become the abode of man.
  Odin then regulated the periods of day and night and the seasons
  by placing in the heavens the sun and moon, and appointing to them
  their respective courses. As soon as the sun began to shed its rays
  upon the earth, it caused the vegetable world to bud and sprout.
  Shortly after the gods had created the world they walked by the side
  of the sea, pleased with their new work, but found that it was still
  incomplete, for it was without human beings. They therefore took an
  ash tree and made a man out of it, and they made a woman out of an
  alder, and called the man Aske and the woman Embla. Odin then gave
  them life and soul, Vili reason and motion, and Ve bestowed upon
  them the senses, expressive features, and speech. Midgard was then
  given them as their residence, and they became the progenitors of
  the human race.
  The mighty ash tree Ygdrasill was supposed to support the whole
  universe. It sprang from the body of Ymir, and had three immense
  roots; extending one into Asgard (the dwelling of the gods), the other
  into Jotunheim (the abode of the giants), and the third to
  Niffleheim (the regions of darkness and cold). By the side of each
  of these roots is a spring, from which it is watered. The root that
  extends into Asgard is carefully tended by the three Norns, goddesses,
  who are regarded as the dispensers of fate. They are Urdur (the past),
  Verdandi (the present), Skuld (the future). The spring at the
  Jotunheim side is Ymir's well, in which wisdom and wit lie hidden, but
  that of Niffleheim feeds the adder Nidhogge (darkness), which
  perpetually gnaws at the root. Four harts run across the branches of
  the tree and bite the buds; they represent the four winds. Under the
  tree lies Ymir, and when he tries to shake off its weight the earth
  quakes.
  Asgard is the name of the abode of the gods, access to which is only
  gained by crossing the bridge Bifrost (the rainbow). Asgard consists
  of golden and silver palaces, the dwellings of the gods, but the
  most beautiful of these is Valhalla, the residence of Odin. When
  seated on his throne he overlooks all heaven and earth. Upon his
  shoulders are the ravens Hugin and Munin, who fly every day over the
  whole world, and on their return report to him all they have seen
  and heard. At his feet lie his two wolves, Geri and Freki, to whom
  Odin gives all the meat that is set before him, for he himself
  stands in no need of food. Mead is for him both food and drink. He
  invented the Runic characters, and it is the business of the Norns
  to engrave the runes of fate upon a metal shield. From Odin's name,
  spelt Woden, as it sometimes is, came Wednesday, the name of the
  fourth day of the week.
  Odin is frequently called Alfdaur (All-father), but this name is
  sometimes used in a way that shows that the Scandinavians had an
  idea of a deity superior to Odin, uncreated and eternal.
