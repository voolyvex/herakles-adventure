BAUCIS AND PHILEMON
  On a certain hill in Phrygia stands a linden tree and an oak,
  enclosed by a low wall. Not far from the spot is a marsh, formerly
  good habitable land, but now indented with pools, the resort of
  fen-birds and cormorants. Once on a time Jupiter, in human shape,
  visited this country, and with him his son Mercury (he of the
  caduceus), without his wings. They presented themselves, as weary
  travellers, at many a door, seeking rest and shelter, but found all
  closed, for it was late, and the inhospitable inhabitants would not
  rouse themselves to open for their reception. At last a humble mansion
  received them, a small thatched cottage, where Baucis, a pious old
  dame, and her husband Philemon, united when young, had grown old
  together. Not ashamed of their poverty, they made it endurable by
  moderate desires and kind dispositions. One need not look there for
  master or for servant; they two were the whole household, master and
  servant alike. When the two heavenly guests crossed the humble
  threshold, and bowed their heads to pass under the low door, the old
  man placed a seat, on which Baucis, bustling and attentive, spread a
  cloth, and begged them to sit down. Then she raked out the coals
  from the ashes, and kindled up a fire, fed it with leaves and dry
  bark, and with her scanty breath blew it into a flame. She brought out
  of a corner split sticks and dry branches, broke them up, and placed
  them under the small kettle. Her husband collected some pot-herbs in
  the garden, and she shred them from the stalks, and prepared them
  for the pot. He reached down with a forked stick a flitch of bacon
  hanging in the chimney, cut a small piece, and put it in the pot to
  boil with the herbs, setting away the rest for another time. A beechen
  bowl was filled with warm water, that their guests might wash. While
  all was doing, they beguiled the time with conversation.
  On the bench designed for the guests was laid a cushion stuffed with
  sea-weed; and a cloth, only produced on great occasions, but ancient
  and coarse enough, was spread over that. The old lady, with her
  apron on, with trembling hand set the table. One leg was shorter
  than the rest, but a piece of slate put under restored the level. When
  fixed, she rubbed the table down with some sweet-smelling herbs.
  Upon it she set some of chaste Minerva's olives, some cornel berries
  preserved in vinegar, and added radishes and cheese, with eggs lightly
  cooked in the ashes. All were served in earthen dishes, and an
  earthenware pitcher, with wooden cups, stood beside them. When all was
  ready, the stew, smoking hot, was set on the table. Some wine, not
  of the oldest, was added; and for dessert, apples and wild honey;
  and over and above all, friendly faces, and simple but hearty welcome.
  Now while the repast proceeded, the old folks were astonished to see
  that the wine, as fast as it was poured out, renewed itself in the
  pitcher, of its own accord. Struck with terror, Baucis and Philemon
  recognized their heavenly guests, fell on their knees, and with
  clasped hands implored forgiveness for their poor entertainment. There
  was an old goose, which they kept as the guardian of their humble
  cottage; and they bethought them to make this a sacrifice in honour of
  their guests. But the goose, too nimble, with the aid of feet and
  wings, for the old folks, eluded their pursuit, and at last took
  shelter between the gods themselves. They forbade it to be slain;
  and spoke in these words: "We are gods. This inhospitable village
  shall pay the penalty of its impiety; you alone shall go free from the
  chastisement. Quit your house, and come with us to the top of yonder
  hill." They hastened to obey, and, staff in hand, laboured up the
  steep ascent. They had reached to within an arrow's flight of the top,
  when, turning their eyes below, they beheld all the country sunk in
  a lake, only their own house left standing. While they gazed with
  wonder at the sight, and lamented the fate of their neighbours, that
  old house of theirs was changed into a temple. Columns took the
  place of the corner posts, the thatch grew yellow and appeared a
  gilded roof, the floors became marble, the doors were enriched with
  carving and ornaments of old. Then spoke Jupiter in benignant accents:
  "Excellent old man, and woman worthy of such a husband, speak, tell us
  your wishes; what favour have you to ask of us?" Philemon took counsel
  with Baucis a few moments; then declared to the gods their united
  wish, "We ask to be priests and guardians of this your temple; and
  since here we have passed our lives in love and concord, we wish
  that one and the same hour may take us both from life, that I may
  not live to see her grave, nor be laid in my own by her." Their prayer
  was granted. They were the keepers of the temple as long as they
  lived. When grown very old, as they stood one day before the steps
  of the sacred edifice, and were telling the story of the place, Baucis
  saw Philemon begin to put forth leaves, and old Philemon saw Baucis
  changing in like manner. And now a leafy crown had grown over their
  heads, while exchanging parting words, as long as they could speak.
  "Farewell, dear spouse," they said, together, and at the same moment
  the bark closed over their mouths. The Tyanean shepherd still shows
  the two trees, standing side by side, made out of the two good old
  people.

  The story of Baucis and Philemon has been imitated by Swift, in a
  burlesque style, the actors in the change being two wandering
  saints, and the house being changed into a church, of which Philemon
  is made the parson. The following may serve as a specimen:

  "They scarce had spoke, when, fair and soft,
  The root began to mount aloft;
  Aloft rose every beam and rafter;
  The heavy wall climbed slowly after.
  The chimney widened and grew higher,
  Became a steeple with a spire.
  The kettle to the top was hoist,
  And there stood fastened to a joist,
  But with the upside down, to show,
  Its inclination for below;
  In vain, for a superior force,
  Applied at bottom, stops its course;
  Doomed ever in suspense to dwell,
  'Tis now no kettle, but a bell.
  A wooden jack, which had almost
  Lost by disuse the art to roast,
  A sudden alteration feels.
  Increased by new intestine wheels;
  And, what exalts the wonder more,
  The number made the motion slower;
  The flier, though 't had leaden feet,
  Turned round so quick you scarce could see 't;
  But slackened by some secret power,
  Now hardly moves an inch an hour.
  The jack and chimney, near allied,
  Had never left each other's side:
  The chimney to a steeple grown,
  The jack would not be left alone;
  But up against the steeple reared,
  Became a clock, and still adhered;
  And still its love to household cares
  By a shrill voice at noon declares,
  Warning the cook-maid not to burn
  That roast meat which it cannot turn.
  The groaning chair began to crawl,
  Like a huge snail, along the wall;
  There stuck aloft in public view,
  And with small change, a pulpit grew.
  A bedstead of the antique mode,
  Compact of timber many a load,
  Such as our ancestors did use,
  Was metamorphosed into pews,
  Which still their ancient nature keep
  By lodging folks disposed to sleep."
