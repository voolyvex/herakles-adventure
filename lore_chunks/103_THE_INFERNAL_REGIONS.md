THE INFERNAL REGIONS
  AS at the commencement of our series we have given the pagan account
  of the creation of the world, so as we approach its conclusion we
  present a view of the regions of the dead, depicted by one of their
  most enlightened poets, who drew his doctrines from their most
  esteemed philosophers. The region where Virgil locates the entrance to
  this abode is perhaps the most strikingly adapted to excite ideas of
  the terrific and preternatural of any on the face of the earth. It
  is the volcanic region near Vesuvius, where the whole country is cleft
  with chasms, from which sulphurous flames arise, while the ground is
  shaken with pent-up vapours, and mysterious sounds issue from the
  bowels of the earth. The lake Avernus is supposed to fill the crater
  of an extinct volcano. It is circular, half a mile wide, and very
  deep, surrounded by high banks, which in Virgil's time were covered
  with a gloomy forest. Mephitic vapours rise from its waters, so that
  no life is found on its banks: and no birds fly over it. Here,
  according to the poet, was the cave which afforded access to the
  infernal regions, and here AEneas offered sacrifices to the infernal
  deities, Proserpine, Hecate, and the Furies. Then a roaring was
  heard in the earth, the woods on the hill-tops were shaken, and the
  howling of dogs announced the approach of the deities. "Now," said the
  Sibyl, "summon up your courage, for you will need it." She descended
  into the cave, and AEneas followed. Before the threshold of hell
  they passed through a group of beings who are enumerated as Griefs and
  avenging Cares, pale Diseases and melancholy Age, Fear and Hunger that
  tempt to crime, Toil, Poverty, and Death,- forms horrible to view. The
  Furies spread the couches there, and Discord, whose hair was of vipers
  tied up with a bloody fillet. Here also were the monsters, Briareus,
  with his hundred arms, Hydras hissing, and Chimaeras breathing fire.
  AEneas shuddered at the sight, drew his sword and would have struck,
  but the Sibyl restrained him. They then came to the black river
  Cocytus, where they found the ferryman, Charon, old and squalid, but
  strong and vigorous, who was receiving passengers of all kinds into
  his boat, magnanimous heroes, boys and unmarried girls, as numerous as
  the leaves that fall at autumn, or the flocks that fly southward at
  the approach of winter. They stood pressing for a passage and
  longing to touch the opposite shore, But the stern ferryman took in
  only such as he chose, driving the rest back. AEneas, wondering at the
  sight, asked the Sibyl, "Why this discrimination?" She answered,
  "Those who are taken on board the bark are the souls of those who have
  received due burial rites; the host of others who have remained
  unburied are not permitted to pass the flood but wander a hundred
  years, and flit to and fro about the shore, till at last they are
  taken over." AEneas grieved at recollecting some of his own companions
  who had perished in the storm. At that moment he beheld Palinurus, his
  pilot, who fell overboard and was drowned. He addressed him and
  asked him the cause of his misfortune. Palinurus replied that the
  rudder was carried away, and he, clinging to it, was swept away with
  it. He besought AEneas most urgently to extend to him his hand and
  take him in company to the opposite shore. But the Sibyl rebuked him
  for the wish thus to transgress the laws of Pluto; but consoled him by
  informing him that the people of the shore where his body had been
  wafted by the waves should be stirred up by prodigies to give it due
  burial, and that the promontory should bear the name of Cape
  Palinurus, which it does to this day. Leaving Palinurus consoled by
  these words, they approached the boat. Charon, fixing his eyes sternly
  upon the advancing warrior, demanded by what right he, living and
  armed, approached that shore. To which the Sibyl replied that they
  would commit no violence, that AEneas's only object was to see his
  father, and finally exhibited the golden branch, at sight of which
  Charon's wrath relaxed, and he made haste to turn his bark to the
  shore, and receive them on board. The boat, adapted only to the
  light freight of bodiless spirits, groaned under the weight of the
  hero. They were soon conveyed to the opposite shore. There they were
  encountered by the three-headed dog, Cerberus, with his necks
  bristling with snakes. He barked with all his three throats till the
  Sibyl threw him a medicated cake which he eagerly devoured, and then
  stretched himself out in his den and fell asleep. AEneas and the Sibyl
  sprang to land. The first sound that struck their ears was the wailing
  of young children, who had died on the threshold of life, and near
  to these were they who had perished under false charges, Minos
  presides over them as judge, and examines the deeds of each. The
  next class was of those who had died by their own hand, hating life
  and seeking refuge in death. O how willingly would they now endure
  poverty, labour, and any other infliction, if they might but return to
  life! Next were situated the regions of sadness, divided off into
  retired paths, leading through groves of myrtle. Here roamed those who
  had fallen victims to unrequited love, not freed from pain even by
  death itself. Among these, AEneas thought he descried the form of
  Dido, with a wound still recent. In the dim light he was for a
  moment uncertain, but approaching, perceived it was indeed herself.
  Tears fell from his eyes, and he addressed her in the accents of love.
  "Unhappy Dido! was then the rumour true that you had perished? and was
  I, alas! the cause? I call the gods to witness that my departure
  from you was reluctant, and in obedience to the commands of Jove;
  nor could I believe that my absence would cost you so dear. Stop, I
  beseech you, and refuse me not a last farewell." She stood for a
  moment with averted countenance, and eyes fixed on the ground, and
  then silently passed on, as insensible to his pleadings as a rock.
  AEneas followed for some distance; then, with a heavy heart,
  rejoined his companion and resumed his route.
  They next entered the fields where roam the heroes who have fallen
  in battle. Here they saw many shades of Grecian and Trojan warriors.
  The Trojans thronged around him, and could not be satisfied with the
  sight. They asked the cause of his coming, and plied him with
  innumerable questions. But the Greeks, at the sight of his armour
  glittering through the murky atmosphere, recognized the hero, and
  filled with terror turned their backs and fled, as they used to do
  on the plains of Troy.
  AEneas would have lingered long with his Trojan friends, but the
  Sibyl hurried him away. They next came to a place where the road
  divided, the one leading to Elysium, the other to the regions of the
  condemned. AEneas beheld on one side the walls of a mighty city,
  around which Phlegethon rolled its fiery waters, Before him was the
  gate of adamant that neither gods nor men can break through. An iron
  tower stood by the gate, on which Tisiphone, the avenging Fury, kept
  guard. From the city were heard groans, and the sound of the
  scourge, the creaking of iron, and the clanking of chains. AEneas,
  horror-struck, inquired of his guide what crimes were those whose
  punishments produced the sounds he heard? The Sibyl answered, "Here is
  the judgment hall of Rhadamanthus, who brings to light crimes done
  in life, which the perpetrator vainly thought impenetrably hid.
  Tisiphone applies her whip of scorpions, and delivers the offender
  over to her sister Furies." At this moment with horrid clang the
  brazen gates unfolded, and AEneas saw within a Hydra with fifty
  heads guarding the entrance. The Sibyl told him that the gulf of
  Tartarus descended deep, so that its recesses were as far beneath
  their feet as heaven was high above their heads. In the bottom of this
  pit, the Titan race, who warred against the gods, lie prostrate;
  Salmoneus, also, who presumed to vie with Jupiter, and built a
  bridge of brass over which he drove his chariot that the sound might
  resemble thunder, launching flaming brands at his people in
  imitation of lightning, till Jupiter struck him with a real
  thunderbolt, and taught him the difference between mortal weapons
  and divine. Here, also, is Tityus, the giant, whose form is so immense
  that as he lies he stretches over nine acres, while a vulture preys
  upon his liver, which as fast as it is devoured grows again, so that
  his punishment will have no end.
  AEneas saw groups seated at tables loaded with dainties, while
  near by stood a Fury who snatched away the viands from their lips as
  fast as they prepared to taste them. Others beheld suspended over
  their heads huge rocks, threatening to fall, keeping them in a state
  of constant alarm. These were they who had hated their brothers, or
  struck their parents, or defrauded the friends who trusted them, or
  who, having grown rich, kept their money to themselves, and gave no
  share to others; the last being the most numerous class. Here also
  were those who had violated the marriage vow, or fought in a bad
  cause, or failed in fidelity to their employers. Here was one who
  had sold his country for gold, another who perverted the laws,
  making them say one thing to-day and another to-morrow.
  Ixion was there, fastened to the circumference of a wheel
  ceaselessly revolving; and Sisyphus, whose task was to roll a huge
  stone up to a hill-top, but when the steep was well-nigh gained, the
  rock, repulsed by some sudden force, rushed again-headlong down to the
  plain. Again he toiled at it, while the sweat bathed all his weary
  limbs, but all to no effect. There was Tantalus, who stood in a
  pool, his chin level with the water, yet he was parched with thirst,
  and found nothing to assuage it; for when he bowed his hoary head,
  eager to quaff, the water fled away, leaving the ground at his feet
  all dry. Tall trees laden with fruit stooped their heads to him,
  pears, pomegranates, apples, and luscious figs; but when with a sudden
  grasp he tried to seize them winds whirled them high above his reach.
  The Sibyl now warned AEneas it was time to turn from these
  melancholy regions and seek the city of the blessed. They passed
  through a middle tract of darkness, and came upon the Elysian
  fields, the groves where the happy reside. They breathed a freer
  air, and saw all objects clothed in a purple light. The region has a
  sun and stars of its own. The inhabitants were enjoying themselves
  in various ways, some in sports on the grassy turf, in games of
  strength or skill, others dancing or singing. Orpheus struck the
  chords of his lyre, and called forth ravishing sounds. Here AEneas saw
  the founders of the Trojan state, magnanimous heroes who lived in
  happier times. He gazed with admiration on the war chariots and
  glittering arms now reposing in disuse. Spears stood fixed in the
  ground, and the horses, unharnessed, roamed over the plain. The same
  pride in splendid armour and generous steeds which the old heroes felt
  in life, accompanied them here. He saw another group feasting and
  listening to the strains of music. They were in a laurel grove, whence
  the great river Po has its origin, and flows out among men. Here dwelt
  those who fell by wounds received in their country's cause, holy
  priests also, and poets who have uttered thoughts worthy of Apollo,
  and others who have contributed to cheer and adorn life by their
  discoveries in the useful arts, and have made their memory blessed
  by rendering service to mankind. They wore snow-white fillets about
  their brows. The Sibyl addressed a group of these, and inquired
  where Anchises was to be found. They were directed where to seek
  him, and soon found him in a verdant valley, where he was
  contemplating the ranks of his posterity, their destinies and worthy
  deeds to be achieved in coming times. When he recognized AEneas
  approaching, he stretched out both hands to him, while tears flowed
  freely. "Have you come at last," said he, "long expected, and do I
  behold you after such perils past? O my son, how have I trembled for
  you as I have watched your career!" To which AEneas replied, "O
  father! your image was always before me to guide and guard me." Then
  he endeavoured to enfold his father in his embrace, but his arms
  enclosed only an unsubstantial image.
  AEneas perceived before him a spacious valley, with trees gently
  waving to the wind, a tranquil landscape, through which the river
  Lethe flowed. Along the banks of the stream wandered a countless
  multitude, numerous as insects in the summer air. AEneas, with
  surprise, inquired who were these. Anchises answered, "They are
  souls to which bodies are to be given in due time. Meanwhile they
  dwell on Lethe's bank, and drink oblivion of their former lives." "O
  father!" said AEneas, "is it possible that any can be so in love
  with life as to wish to leave these tranquil seats for the upper
  world?" Anchises replied by explaining the plan of creation. The
  Creator, he told him, originally made the material of which souls
  are composed of the four elements, fire, air, earth, and water, all
  which when united took the form of the most excellent part, fire,
  and became flame. This material was scattered like seed among the
  heavenly bodies, the sun, moon, and stars. Of this seed the inferior
  gods created man and all other animals, mingling it with various
  proportions of earth, by which its purity was alloyed and reduced.
  Thus, the more earth predominates in the composition the less pure
  is the individual; and we see men and women with their full-grown
  bodies have not the purity of childhood. So in proportion to the
  time which the union of body and soul has lasted is the impurity
  contracted by the spiritual part. This impurity must be purged away
  after death, which is done by ventilating the souls in the current
  of winds, or merging them in water, or burning out their impurities by
  fire. Some few, of whom Anchises intimates that he is one, are
  admitted at once to Elysium, there to remain. But the rest, after
  the impurities of earth are purged away, are sent back to life endowed
  with new bodies, having had the remembrance of their former lives
  effectually washed away by the waters of Lethe. Some, however, there
  still are, so thoroughly corrupted, that they are not fit to be
  intrusted with human bodies, and these are made into brute animals,
  lions, tigers, cats, dogs, monkeys, etc. This is what the ancients
  called Metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls; a doctrine
  which is still held by the natives of India, who scruple to destroy
  the life even of the most insignificant animal, not knowing but it may
  be one of their relations in an altered form.
  Anchises, having explained so much, proceeded to point out to AEneas
  individuals of his race, who were hereafter to be born, and to
  relate to him the exploits they should perform in the world. After
  this he reverted to the present, and told his son of the events that
  remained to him to be accomplished before the complete establishment
  of himself and his followers in Italy. Wars were to be waged,
  battles fought, a bride to be won, and in the result a Trojan state
  founded, from which should arise the Roman power, to be in time the
  sovereign of the world.
  AEneas and the Sibyl then took leave of Anchises, and returned by
  some short cut, which the poet does not explain, to the upper world.
