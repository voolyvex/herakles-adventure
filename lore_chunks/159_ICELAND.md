ICELAND
  The Eddas and Sagas have come to us from Iceland. The following
  extract from Carlyle's lectures on "Heroes and Hero Worship" gives
  an animated account of the region where the strange stories we have
  been reading had their origin. Let the reader contrast it for a moment
  with Greece, the parent of classical mythology:
  "In that strange island, Iceland,- burst up, the geologists say,
  by fire from the bottom of the sea, a wild land of barrenness and
  lava, swallowed many months of every year in black tempests, yet
  with a wild, gleaming beauty in summer time, towering up there stern
  and grim in the North Ocean, with its snow yokuls [mountains], roaring
  geysers [boiling springs], sulphur pools, and horrid volcanic
  chasms, like the waste, chaotic battlefield of Frost and Fire,- where,
  of all places, we least looked for literature or written memorials,-
  the record of these things was written down. On the seaboard of this
  wild land is a rim of grassy country, where cattle can subsist, and
  men by means of them and of what the sea yields; and it seems they
  were poetic men these, men who had deep thoughts in them and uttered
  musically their thoughts. Much would be lost had Iceland not been
  burst up from the sea, not been discovered by the Northmen!"
