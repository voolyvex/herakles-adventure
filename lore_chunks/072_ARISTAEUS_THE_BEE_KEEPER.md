ARISTAEUS, THE BEE-KEEPER
  Man avails himself of the instincts of the inferior animals for
  his own advantage. Hence sprang the art of keeping bees. Honey must
  first have been known as a wild product, the bees building their
  structures in hollow trees or holes in the rocks, or any similar
  cavity that chance offered. Thus occasionally the carcass of a dead
  animal would be occupied by the bees for that purpose. It was no doubt
  from some such incident that the superstition arose that the bees were
  engendered by the decaying flesh of the animal; and Virgil, in the
  following story, shows how this supposed fact may be turned to account
  for renewing the swarm when it has been lost by disease or accident.
  Aristaeus, who first taught the management of bees, was the son of
  the water-nymph Cyrene. His bees had perished, and he resorted for aid
  to his mother. He stood at the river side and thus addressed her: "O
  mother, the pride of my life is taken from me! I have lost my precious
  bees. My care and skill have availed me nothing, and you, my mother,
  have not warded off from me the blow of misfortune." His mother
  heard these complaints as she sat in her palace at the bottom of the
  river, with her attendant nymphs around her. They were engaged in
  female occupations, spinning and weaving, while one told stories to
  amuse the rest. The sad voice of Aristaeus interrupting their
  occupation, one of them put her head above the water and seeing him,
  returned and gave information to his mother, who ordered that he
  should be brought into her presence. The river at her command opened
  itself and let him pass in, while it stood curled like a mountain on
  either side. He descended to the region where the fountains of the
  great rivers lie; he saw the enormous receptacles of waters and was
  almost deafened with the roar, while he surveyed them hurrying off
  in various directions to water the face of the earth. Arriving at
  his mother's apartment, he was hospitably received by Cyrene and her
  nymphs, who spread their table with the richest dainties. They first
  poured out libations to Neptune, then regaled themselves with the
  feast, and after that Cyrene thus addressed him: "There is an old
  prophet named Proteus, who dwells in the sea and is a favourite of
  Neptune, whose herd of sea-calves he pastures. We nymphs hold him in
  great respect, for he is a learned sage and knows all things, past,
  present, and to come. He can tell you, my son, the cause of the
  mortality among your bees and how you may remedy it. But he will not
  do it voluntarily, however you may entreat him. You must compel him by
  force. If you seize him and chain him, he will answer your questions
  in order to get released, for he cannot by all his arts get away if
  you hold fast the chains. I will carry you to his cave, where he comes
  at noon to take his midday repose. Then you may easily secure him. But
  when he finds himself captured, his resort is to a power he
  possesses of changing himself into various forms. He will become a
  wild boar or a fierce tiger, a scaly dragon or lion with yellow
  mane. Or be will make a noise like the crackling of flames or the rush
  of water, so as to tempt you to let go the chain, when he will make
  his escape. But you have only to keep him fast bound, and at last when
  he finds all his arts unavailing, he will return to his own figure and
  obey your commands." So saying she sprinkled her son with fragrant
  nectar, the beverage of the gods, and immediately an unusual vigour
  filled his frame, and courage his heart, while perfume breathed all
  around him.
  The nymph led her son to the prophet's cave and concealed him
  among the recesses of the rocks, while she herself took her place
  behind the clouds. When noon came and the hour when men and herds
  retreat from the glaring sun to indulge in quiet slumber, Proteus
  issued from the water, followed by his herd of sea-calves which spread
  themselves along the shore. He sat on the rock and counted his herd;
  then stretched himself on the floor of the cave and went to sleep.
  Aristaeus hardly allowed him to get fairly asleep before he fixed
  the fetters on him and shouted aloud. Proteus, waking and finding
  himself captured, immediately resorted to his arts, becoming first a
  fire, then a flood, then a horrible wild beast, in rapid succession.
  But finding all would not do, he at last resumed his own form and
  addressed the youth in angry accents: "Who are you, bold youth, who
  thus invade my abode, and what do you want with me?" Aristaeus
  replied, "Proteus, you know already, for it is needless for any one to
  attempt to deceive you. And do you also cease your efforts to elude
  me. I am led hither by divine assistance, to know from you the cause
  of my misfortune and how to remedy it." At these words the prophet,
  fixing on him his grey eyes with a piercing look, thus spoke: "You
  receive the merited reward of your deeds, by which Eurydice met her
  death, for in flying from you she trod upon a serpent, of whose bite
  she died. To avenge her death, the nymphs, her companions, have sent
  this destruction to your bees. You have to appease their anger, and
  thus it must be done: Select four bulls, of perfect form and size, and
  four cows of equal beauty, build four altars to the nymphs, and
  sacrifice the animals, leaving their carcasses in the leafy grove.
  To Orpheus and Eurydice you shall pay such funeral honours as may
  allay their resentment. Returning after nine days, you will examine
  the bodies of the cattle slain and see what will befall." Aristaeus
  faithfully obeyed these directions. He sacrificed the cattle, he
  left their bodies in the grove, he offered funeral honours to the
  shades of Orpheus and Eurydice; then returning on the ninth day he
  examined the bodies of the animals, and, wonderful to relate! a
  swarm of bees had taken possession of one of the carcasses and were
  pursuing their labours there as in a hive.

  In "The Task," Cowper alludes to the story of Aristaeus, when
  speaking of the ice-palace built by the Empress Anne of Russia. He has
  been describing the fantastic forms which ice assumes in connection
  with waterfalls. etc.:

  "Less worthy of applause though more admired
  Because a novelty, the work of man,
  Imperial mistress of the fur-clad Russ,
  Thy most magnificent and mighty freak,
  The wonder of the north. No forest fell
  When thou wouldst build, no quarry sent its stores
  T' enrich thy walls; but thou didst hew the floods
  And make thy marble of the glassy wave.
  In such a palace Aristaeus found
  Cyrene, when he bore the plaintive tale
  Of his lost bees to her maternal ear."

  Milton also appears to have had Cyrene and her domestic scene in his
  mind when he describes to us Sabrina, the nymph of the river Severn,
  in the Guardian-spirit's song in "Comus":

  "Sabrina fair!
  Listen where thou art sitting
  Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave
  In twisted braids of lilies knitting
  The loose train of thy amber-drooping hair;
  Listen for dear honour's sake,
  Goddess of the silver lake!
  Listen and save."

  some of whom were hardly inferior to Orpheus himself:
