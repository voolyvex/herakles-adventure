THE FUNERAL OF BALDUR
  The gods took up the dead body and bore it to the seashore where
  stood Baldur's ship "Hringham," which passed for the largest in the
  world. Baldur's dead body was put on the funeral pile, on board the
  ship, and his wife Nanna was so struck with grief at the sight that
  she broke her heart, and her body was burned on the same pile with her
  husband's. There was a vast concourse of various kinds of people at
  Baldur's obsequies. First came Odin accompanied by Frigga, the
  Valkyrior, and his ravens; then Frey in his car drawn by Gullinbursti,
  the boar; Heimdall rode his horse Gulltopp, and Freya drove in her
  chariot drawn by cats. There were also a great many Frost giants and
  giants of the mountain present. Baldur's horse was led to the pile
  fully caparisoned and consumed in the same flames with his master.
  But Loki did not escape his deserved punishment. When he saw how
  angry the gods were, he fled to the mountain, and there built
  himself a hut with four doors, so that he could see every
  approaching danger. He invented a net to catch the fishes, such as
  fishermen have used since his time. But Odin found out his
  hiding-place and the gods assembled to take him. He, seeing this,
  changed himself into a salmon, and lay hid among the stones of the
  brook. But the gods took his net and dragged the brook, and Loki,
  finding he must be caught, tried to leap over the net; but Thor caught
  him by the tail and compressed it, so that salmons ever since have had
  that part remarkably fine and thin. They bound him with chains and
  suspended a serpent over his head, whose venom falls upon his face
  drop by drop. His wife Siguna sits by his side and catches the drops
  as they fall, in a cup; but when she carries it away to empty it,
  the venom falls upon Loki, which makes him howl with horror, and twist
  his body about so violently that the whole earth shakes, and this
  produces what men call earthquakes.
