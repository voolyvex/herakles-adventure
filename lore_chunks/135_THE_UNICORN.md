THE UNICORN
  Pliny, the Roman naturalist, out of whose account of the unicorn
  most of the modern unicorns have been described and figured, records
  it as "a very ferocious beast, similar in the rest of its body to a
  horse, with the head of a deer, the feet of an elephant, the tail of a
  boar, a deep, bellowing voice, and a single black horn, two cubits
  in length, standing out in the middle of its forehead." He adds that
  "it cannot be taken alive"; and some such excuse may have been
  necessary in those days for not producing the living animal upon the
  arena of the amphitheatre.
  The unicorn seems to have been a sad puzzle to the hunters, who
  hardly knew how to come at so valuable a piece of game. Some described
  the horn as movable at the will of the animal, a kind of small
  sword, in short, with which no hunter who was not exceedingly
  cunning in fence could have a chance. Others maintained that all the
  animal's strength lay in its horn, and that when hard pressed in
  pursuit, it would throw itself from the pinnacle of the highest
  rocks horn foremost, so as to pitch upon it, and then quietly march
  off not a whit the worse for its fall.
  But it seems they found out how to circumvent the poor unicorn at
  last. They discovered that it was a great lover of purity and
  innocence, so they took the field with a young virgin, who was
  placed in the unsuspecting admirer's way. When the unicorn spied
  her, he approached with all reverence, crouched beside her, and laying
  his head in her lap, fell asleep. The treacherous virgin then gave a
  signal, and the hunters made in and captured the simple beast.
  Modern zoologists, disgusted as they well may be with such fables as
  these, disbelieved generally the existence of the unicorn. Yet there
  are animals bearing on their heads a bony protuberance more or less
  like a horn, which may have given rise to the story. The rhinoceros
  horn, as it is called, is such a protuberance, though it does not
  exceed a few inches in height, and is far from agreeing with the
  descriptions of the horn of the unicorn. The nearest approach to a
  horn in the middle of the forehead is exhibited in the bony
  protuberance on the forehead of the giraffe; but this also is short
  and blunt, and is not the only horn of the animal, but a third horn,
  standing in front of the two others. In fine, though it would be
  presumptuous to deny the existence of a one-horned quadruped other
  than the rhinoceros, it may be safely stated that the insertion of a
  long and solid horn in the living forehead of a horse-like or
  deer-like animal is as near an impossibility as anything can be.
