HERO AND LEANDER
  Leander was a youth of Abydos, a town of the Asian side of the
  strait which separates Asia and Europe. On the opposite shore, in
  the town of Sestos, lived the maiden Hero, a priestess of Venus.
  Leander loved her, and used to swim the strait nightly to enjoy the
  company of his mistress, guided by a torch which she reared upon the
  tower for the purpose. But one night a tempest arose and the sea was
  rough; his strength failed, and he was drowned. The waves bore his
  body to the European shore, where Hero became aware of his death,
  and in her despair cast herself down from the tower into the sea and
  perished.

  The following sonnet is by Keats:

  "ON A PICTURE OF LEANDER.

  "Come hither all sweet Maidens soberly
  Down looking aye, and with a chasten'd light
  Hid in the fringes of your eyelids white,
  And meekly let your fair hands joined be,
  As if so gentle that ye could not see,
  Untouch'd, a victim of your beauty bright,
  Sinking away to his young spirit's night,
  Sinking bewilder'd 'mid the dreary sea.
  'Tis young Leander toiling to his death.
  Nigh swooning he doth purse his weary lips
  For Hero's cheek, and smiles against her smile.
  O horrid dream! see how his body dips
  Dead-heavy; arms and shoulders gleam awhile;
  He's gone; up bubbles all his amorous breath!"

  The story of Leander's swimming the Hellespont was looked upon as
  fabulous, and the feat considered impossible, till Lord Byron proved
  its possibility by performing it himself. In the "Bride of Abydos"
  he says,

  "These limbs that buoyant wave hath borne."

  The distance in the narrowest part is almost a mile, and there is
  a constant current setting out from the Sea of Marmora into the
  Archipelago. Since Byron's time the feat has been achieved by
  others; but it yet remains a test of strength and skill in the art
  of swimming sufficient. to give a wide and lasting celebrity to any
  one of our readers who may dare to make the attempt and succeed in
  accomplishing it.

  In the beginning, of the second canto of the same poem, Byron thus
  alludes to this story:

  "The winds are high on Helle's wave,
  As on that night of stormiest water,
  When Love, who sent, forgot to save
  The young, the beautiful, the brave,
  The lonely hope of Sestos' daughter.
  O, when alone along the sky
  The turret-torch was blazing high,
  Though rising gale and breaking foam,
  And shrieking sea-birds warned him home;
  And clouds aloft and tides below,
  With signs and sounds forbade to go,
  He could not see, he would not hear
  Or sound or sight foreboding fear.
  His eye but saw that light of love,
  The only star it hailed above;
  His ear but rang with Hero's song,
  'Ye waves, divide not lovers long.'
  That tale is old, but love anew
  May nerve young hearts to prove as true."
