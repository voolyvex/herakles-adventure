ARIADNE
  We have seen in the story of Theseus how Ariadne, the daughter of
  King Minos, after helping Theseus to escape from the labyrinth, was
  carried by him to the island of Naxos and was left there asleep, while
  the ungrateful Theseus pursued his way home without her. Ariadne, on
  waking and finding herself deserted, abandoned herself to grief. But
  Venus took pity on her, and consoled her with the promise that she
  should have an immortal lover, instead of the mortal one she had lost.
  The island where Ariadne was left was the favourite island of
  Bacchus, the same that he wished the Tyrrhenian mariners to carry
  him to, when they so treacherously attempted to make prize of him.
  As Ariadne sat lamenting her fate, Bacchus found her, consoled her,
  and made her his wife. As a marriage present he gave her a golden
  crown, enriched with gems, and when she died, he took her crown and
  threw it up into the sky. As it mounted the gems grew brighter and
  were turned into stars, and preserving its form Ariadne's crown
  remains fixed in the heavens as a constellation, between the
  kneeling Hercules and the man who holds the serpent.

  Spenser alludes to Ariadne's crown, though he has made some mistakes
  in his mythology. It was at the wedding of Pirithous, and not Theseus,
  that the Centaurs and Lapithae quarrelled.

  "Look how the crown which Ariadne wore
  Upon her ivory forehead that same day
  That Theseus her unto his bridal bore,
  Then the bold Centaurs made that bloody fray
  With the fierce Lapiths which did them dismay;
  Being now placed in the firmament,
  Through the bright heaven doth her beams display,
  And is unto the stars an ornament,
  Which round about her move in order excellent."
