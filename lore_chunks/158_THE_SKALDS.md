THE SKALDS
  The Skalds were the bards and poets of the nation, a very
  important class of men in all communities in an early stage of
  civilization. They are the depositaries of whatever historic lore
  there is, and it is their office to mingle something of intellectual
  gratification with the rude feasts of the warriors, by rehearsing,
  with such accomplishments of poetry and music as their skill can
  afford, the exploits of their heroes, living or dead. The compositions
  of the Skalds were called Sagas, many of which have come down to us,
  and contain valuable materials of history, and a faithful picture of
  the state of society at the time to which they relate.
