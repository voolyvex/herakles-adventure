PERSEUS AND MEDUSA
  Perseus was the son of Jupiter and Danae. His grandfather
  Acrisius, alarmed by an oracle which had told him that his
  daughter's child would be the instrument of his death, caused the
  mother and child to be shut up in a chest and set adrift on the sea.
  The chest floated towards Seriphus, where it was found by a
  fisherman who conveyed the mother and infant to Polydectes, the king
  of the country, by whom they were treated with kindness. When
  Perseus was grown up Polydectes sent him to attempt the conquest of
  Medusa, a terrible monster who had laid waste the country. She was
  once a beautiful maiden whose hair was her chief glory but as she
  dared to vie in beauty with Minerva, the goddess deprived her of her
  charms and changed her beautiful ringlets into hissing serpents. She
  became a cruel monster of so frightful an aspect that no living
  thing could behold her without being turned into stone. All around the
  cavern where she dwelt might be seen the stony figures of men and
  animals which had chanced to catch a glimpse of her and had been
  petrified with the sight. Perseus, favoured by Minerva and Mercury,
  the former of whom lent him her shield and the latter his winged
  shoes, approached Medusa while she slept and taking care not to look
  directly at her, but guided by her image reflected in the bright
  shield which he bore, he cut off her head and gave it to Minerva,
  who fixed it in the middle of her AEgis.

  Milton, in his "Comus," thus alludes to the AEgis:

  "What thus snaky-headed Gorgon-shield
  That wise Minerva wore, unconquered virgin,
  Wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone,
  But rigid looks of chaste austerity,
  And noble grace that dashed brute violence
  With sudden adoration and blank awe!"

  Armstrong, the poet of the "Art of Preserving Health," thus
  describes the effect of frost upon the waters:

  "Now blows the surly North and chills throughout
  The stiffening regions, while by stronger charms
  Than Circe e'er or fell Medea brewed,
  Each brook that wont to prattle to its banks
  Lies all bestilled and wedged betwixt its banks,
  Nor moves the withered reeds...
  The surges baited by the fierce North-east,
  Tossing with fretful spleen their angry heads,
  E'en in the foam of all their madness struck
  To monumental ice.

  . . . . . . . .
  Such execution,
  So stern, so sudden, wrought the grisly aspect
  Of terrible Medusa,
  When wandering through the woods she turned to stone
  Their savage tenants; just as the foaming Lion
  Sprang furious on his prey, her speedier power
  Outran his haste,
  And fixed in that fierce attitude he stands
  Like Rage in marble!"- Imitations of Shakespeare.
