ORACLE OF AESCULAPIUS
  There were numerous oracles of AEsculapius, but the most
  celebrated one was at Epidaurus. Here the sick sought responses and
  the recovery of their health by sleeping in the temple. It has been
  inferred from the accounts that have come down to us that the
  treatment of the sick resembled what is now called Animal Magnetism or
  Mesmerism.
  Serpents were sacred to AEsculapius, probably because of a
  superstition that those animals have a faculty of renewing their youth
  by a change of skin.
  The worship of AEsculapius was introduced into Rome in a time of
  great sickness, and an embassy sent to the temple of Epidaurus to
  entreat the aid of the god. AEsculapius was propitious and on the
  return of the ship accompanied it in the form of a serpent. Arriving
  in the river Tiber, the serpent glided from the vessel and took
  possession of an island in the river, and a temple was there erected
  to his honour.
