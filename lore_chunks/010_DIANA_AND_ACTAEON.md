DIANA AND ACTAEON
  Thus in two instances we have seen Juno's severity to her rivals;
  now let us learn how a virgin goddess punished an invader of her
  privacy.
  It was midday, and the sun stood equally distant from either goal,
  when young Actaeon, son of King Cadmus, thus addressed the youths
  who with him were hunting the stag in the mountains:
  "Friends, our nets and our weapons are wet with the blood of our
  victims; we have had sport enough for one day, and to-morrow we can
  renew our labours. Now, while Phoebus parches the earth, let us put by
  our implements and indulge ourselves with rest."
  There was a valley thick enclosed with cypresses and pines, sacred
  to the huntress queen, Diana. In the extremity of the valley was a
  cave, not adorned with art, but nature had counterfeited art in its
  construction, for she had turned the arch of its roof with stones,
  as delicately fitted as if by the hand of man. A fountain burst out
  from one side, whose open basin was bounded by a grassy rim. Here
  the goddess of the woods used to come when weary with hunting and lave
  her virgin limbs in the sparkling water.
  One day, having repaired thither with her nymphs, she handed her
  javelin, her quiver, and her bow to one, her robe to another, while
  a third unbound the sandals from her feet. Then Crocale, the most
  skilful of them, arranged her hair, and Nephele, Hyale, and the rest
  drew water in capacious urns. While the goddess was thus employed in
  the labours of the toilet, behold Actaeon, having quitted his
  companions, and rambling without any especial object, came to the
  place, led thither by his destiny. As he presented himself at the
  entrance of the cave, the nymphs, seeing a man, screamed and rushed
  towards the goddess to hide her with their bodies, but she was
  taller than the rest and overtopped them all by a head. Such a
  colour as tinges the clouds at sunset or at dawn came over the
  countenance of Diana thus taken by surprise. Surrounded as she was
  by her nymphs, she yet turned half away, and sought with a sudden
  impulse for her arrows. As they were not at hand, she dashed the water
  into the face of the intruder, adding these words: "Now go and tell,
  if you can, that you have seen Diana unapparelled." Immediately a pair
  of branching stag's horns grew out of his head, his neck gained in
  length, his ears grew sharp-pointed, his hands became feet, his arms
  long legs, his body was covered with a hairy spotted hide. Fear took
  the place of his former boldness, and the hero fled. He could not
  but admire his own speed; but when he saw his horns in the water, "Ah,
  wretched me!" he would have said, but no sound followed the effort. He
  groaned, and tears flowed down the face which had taken the place of
  his own. Yet his consciousness remained. What shall he do?- go home to
  seek the palace, or lie hid in the woods? The latter he was afraid,
  the former he was ashamed to do. While he hesitated the dogs saw
  him. First Melampus, a Spartan dog, gave the signal with his bark,
  then Pamphagus, Dorceus, Lelaps, Theron, Nape, Tigris, and all the
  rest, rushed after him swifter than the wind. Over rocks cliffs,
  through mountain gorges seemed impracticable, he fled and they
  followed. Where he had often chased the stag and cheered on his
  pack, his pack now chased him, cheered on by his huntsmen. He longed
  to cry out, "I am Actaeon; recognize your master!" but the words
  came not at his will. The air resounded with the bark of the dogs.
  Presently one fastened on his back, another seized his shoulder. While
  they held their master, the rest of the pack came up and buried
  their teeth in his flesh. He groaned,- not in a human voice, yet
  certainly not in a stag's,- and falling on his knees, raised his eyes,
  and would have raised his arms in supplication, if he had had them.
  His friends and fellow-huntsmen cheered on the dogs, and looked
  everywhere for Actaeon calling on him to join the sport. At the
  sound of his name he turned his head, and heard them regret that he
  should be away. He earnestly wished he was. He would have been well
  pleased to see the exploits of his dogs, but to feel them was too
  much. They were all around him, rending and tearing; and it was not
  till they had torn his life out that the anger of Diana was satisfied.

  In Shelley's poem "Adonais" is the following allusion to the story
  of Actaeon:

  "Midst others of less note came one frail form,
  A phantom among men: companionless
  As the last cloud of an expiring storm,
  Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,
  Had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness,
  Actaeon-like, and now he fled astray
  With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness;
  And his own Thoughts, along that rugged way,
  Pursued like raging hounds their father and their prey."
  Stanza 31.

  The allusion is probably to Shelley himself.
