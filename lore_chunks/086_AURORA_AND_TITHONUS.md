AURORA AND TITHONUS
  The goddess of the Dawn, like her sister the Moon, was at times
  inspired with the love of mortals. Her greatest favourite was Tithonus
  son of Laomedon, king of Troy. She stole him away, and prevailed on
  Jupiter to grant him immortality; but, forgetting to have youth joined
  in the gift, after some time she began to discern, to her great
  mortification, that he was growing old. When his hair was quite
  white she left his society; but he still had the range of her
  palace, lived on ambrosial food, and was clad in celestial raiment. At
  length he lost the power of using his limbs, and then she shut him
  up in his chamber, whence his feeble voice might at times be heard.
  Finally she turned him into a grasshopper.
  Memnon was the son of Aurora and Tithonus. He was king of the
  AEthiopians, and dwelt in the extreme east, on the shore of Ocean.
  He came with his warriors to assist the kindred of his father in the
  war of Troy. King Priam received him with great honours, and
  listened with admiration to his narrative of the wonders of the
  ocean shore.
  The very day after his arrival, Memnon, impatient of repose, led his
  troops to the field. Antilochus, the brave son of Nestor, fell by
  his hand, and the Greeks were put to flight, when Achilles appeared
  and restored the battle. A long and doubtful contest ensued between
  him and the son of Aurora; at length victory declared for Achilles,
  Memnon fell, and the Trojans fled in dismay.
  Aurora, who from her station in the sky had viewed with apprehension
  the danger of her son, when she saw him fall, directed his brothers,
  the Winds, to convey his body to the banks of the river Esepus in
  Paphlagonia. In the evening Aurora came, accompanied by the Hours
  and the Pleiads, and wept and lamented over her son. Night, in
  sympathy with her grief, spread the heaven with clouds; all nature
  mourned for the offspring of the Dawn. The AEthiopians raised his tomb
  on the banks of the stream in the grove of the Nymphs, and Jupiter
  caused the sparks and cinders of his funeral pile to be turned into
  birds, which, dividing into two flocks, fought over the pile till they
  fell into the flames. Every year at the anniversary of his death
  they return and celebrate his obsequies in like manner. Aurora remains
  inconsolable for the loss of her son. Her tears still flow, and may be
  seen at early morning in the form of dew-drops on the grass.

  Unlike most of the marvels of ancient mythology, there still exist
  some memorials of this. On the banks of the river Nile, in Egypt,
  are two colossal statues, one of which is said to be the statue of
  Memnon. Ancient writers record that when the first rays of the
  rising sun fall upon this statue a sound is heard to issue from it,
  which they compare to the snapping of a harp-string. There is some
  doubt about the identification of the existing statue with the one
  described by the ancients, and the mysterious sounds are still more
  doubtful. Yet there are not wanting some modern testimonies to their
  being still audible. It has been suggested that sounds produced by
  confined air making its escape from crevices or caverns in the rocks
  may have given some ground for the story. Sir Gardner Wilkinson, a
  late traveller, of the highest authority, examined the statue
  itself, and discovered that it was hollow, and that "in the lap of the
  statue is a stone, which on being struck emits a metallic sound,
  that might still be made use of to deceive a visitor who was
  predisposed to believe its powers."
  The vocal statue of Memnon is a favourite subject of allusion with
  the poets. Darwin, in his "Botanic Garden," says:

  "So to the sacred Sun in Memnon's fane
  Spontaneous concords choired the matin strain;
  Touched by his orient beam responsive rings
  The living lyre and vibrates all its strings;
  Accordant aisles the tender tones prolong,
  And holy echoes swell the adoring song."
