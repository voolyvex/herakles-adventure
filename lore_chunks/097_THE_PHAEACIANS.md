THE PHAEACIANS
  ULYSSES clung to the raft while any of its timbers kept together,
  and when it no longer yielded him support, binding the girdle around
  him, he swam. Minerva smoothed the billows before him and sent him a
  wind that rolled the waves towards the shore. The surf beat high on
  the rocks and seemed to forbid approach; but at length finding calm
  water at the mouth of a gentle stream, he landed, spent with toil,
  breathless and speechless and almost dead. After some time,
  reviving, he kissed the soil, rejoicing, yet at a loss what course
  to take. At a short distance he perceived a wood to which he turned
  his steps. There, finding a covert sheltered by intermingling branches
  alike from the sun and the rain, he collected a pile of leaves and
  formed a bed, on which he stretched himself, and heaping the leaves
  over him, fell asleep.
  The land where he was thrown was Scheria, the country of the
  Phaeacians. These people dwelt originally near the Cyclopses; but
  being oppressed by that savage race, they migrated to the isle of
  Scheria, under the conduct of Nausithous, their king. They were, the
  poet tells us, a people akin to the gods, who appeared manifestly
  and feasted among them when they offered sacrifices and did not
  conceal themselves from solitary wayfarers when they met them. They
  had abundance of wealth and lived in the enjoyment of it undisturbed
  by the alarms of war, for as they dwelt remote from gain-seeking
  men, no enemy ever approached their shores, and they did not even
  require to make use of bows and quivers. Their chief employment was
  navigation. Their ships, which went with the velocity of birds, were
  endued with intelligence; they knew every port and needed no pilot.
  Alcinous, the son of Nausithous, was now their king, a wise and just
  sovereign, beloved by his people.
  Now it happened that the very night on which Ulysses was cast ashore
  on the Phaeacian island, and while he lay sleeping on his bed of
  leaves, Nausicaa, the daughter of the king, had a dream sent by
  Minerva, reminding her that her wedding-day was not far distant, and
  that it would be but a prudent preparation for that event to have a
  general washing of the clothes of the family. This was no slight
  affair, for the fountains were at some distance, and the garments must
  be carried thither. On awaking, the princess hastened to her parents
  to tell them what was on her mind; not alluding to her wedding-day,
  but finding other reasons equally good. Her father readily assented
  and ordered the grooms to furnish forth a wagon for the purpose. The
  clothes were put therein, and the queen mother placed in the wagon,
  likewise, an abundant supply of food and wine. The princess took her
  seat and plied the lash, her attendant virgins following her on
  foot. Arrived at the river side, they turned out the mules to graze,
  and unlading the carriage, bore the garments down to the water, and
  working with cheerfulness and alacrity, soon despatched their
  labour. Then having spread the garments on the shore to dry, and
  having themselves bathed, they sat down to enjoy their meal; after
  which they rose and amused themselves with a game of ball, the
  princess singing to them while they played. But when they had refolded
  the apparel and were about to resume their way to the town, Minerva
  caused the ball thrown by the princess to fall into the water, whereat
  they all screamed and Ulysses awaked at the sound.
  Now we must picture to ourselves Ulysses, a shipwrecked mariner, but
  a few hours escaped from the waves, and utterly destitute of clothing,
  awaking and discovering that only a few bushes were interposed between
  him and a group of young maidens whom, by their deportment and attire,
  he discovered to be not mere peasant girls, but of a higher class.
  Sadly needing help, how could he yet venture, naked as he was, to
  discover himself and make his wants known? It certainly was a case
  worthy of the interposition of his patron goddess Minerva, who never
  failed him at a crisis. Breaking off a leafy branch from a tree, he
  held it before him and stepped out from the thicket. The virgins at
  sight of him fled in all directions, Nausicaa alone excepted, for
  her Minerva aided and endowed with courage and discernment. Ulysses,
  standing respectfully aloof, told his sad case, and besought the
  fair object (whether queen or goddess he professed he knew not) for
  food and clothing. The princess replied courteously, promising present
  relief and her father's hospitality when he should become acquainted
  with the facts. She called back her scattered maidens, chiding their
  alarm, and reminding them that the Phaeacians had no enemies to
  fear. This man, she told them, was an unhappy wanderer, whom it was
  a duty to cherish, for the poor and stranger are from Jove. She bade
  them bring food and clothing, for some of her brothers' garments
  were among the contents of the wagon. When this was done, and Ulysses,
  retiring to a sheltered place, had washed his body free from the
  sea-foam, clothed and refreshed himself with food, Pallas dilated
  his form and diffused grace over his ample chest and manly brows.
  The princess, seeing him, was filled with admiration, and scrupled
  not to say to her damsels that she wished the gods would send her such
  a husband. To Ulysses she recommended that he should repair to the
  city, following herself and train so far as the way lay through the
  fields; but when they should approach the city she desired that he
  would no longer be seen in her company, for she feared the remarks
  which rude and vulgar people might make on seeing her return
  accompanied by such a gallant stranger. To avoid which she directed
  him to stop at a grove adjoining the city, in which were a farm and
  garden belonging to the king. After allowing time for the princess and
  her companions to reach the city, he was then to pursue his way
  thither, and would be easily guided by any he might meet to the
  royal abode.
  Ulysses obeyed the directions and in due time proceeded to the city,
  on approaching which he met a young woman bearing a pitcher forth
  for water. It was Minerva, who had assumed that form. Ulysses accosted
  her and desired to be directed to the palace of Alcinous the king. The
  maiden replied respectfully, offering to be his guide; for the palace,
  she informed him, stood near her father's dwelling. Under the guidance
  of the goddess, and by her power enveloped in a cloud which shielded
  him from observation, Ulysses passed among the busy crowd, and with
  wonder observed their harbour, their ships, their forum (the resort of
  heroes), and their battlements, till they came to the palace, where
  the goddess, having first given him some information of the country,
  king, and people he was about to meet, left him. Ulysses, before
  entering the courtyard of the palace, stood and surveyed the scene.
  Its splendour astonished him. Brazen walls stretched from the entrance
  to the interior house, of which the doors were gold, the doorposts
  silver, the lintels silver ornamented with gold. On either side were
  figures of mastiffs wrought in gold and silver, standing in rows as if
  to guard the approach. Along the walls were seats spread through all
  their length with mantles of finest texture, the work of Phaeacian
  maidens. On these seats the princes sat and feasted, while golden
  statues of graceful youths held in their hands lighted torches which
  shed radiance over the scene. Full fifty female menials served in
  household offices, some employed to grind the corn, others to wind off
  the purple wool or ply the loom. For the Phaeacian women as far
  exceeded all other women in household arts as the mariners of that
  country did the rest of mankind in the management of ships. Without
  the court a spacious garden lay, four acres in extent. In it grew many
  a lofty tree, pomegranate, pear, apple, fig, and olive. Neither
  winter's cold nor summer's drought arrested their growth, but they
  flourished in constant succession, some budding while others were
  maturing. The vineyard was equally prolific. In one quarter you
  might see the vines, some in blossom, some loaded with ripe grapes,
  and in another observe the vintagers treading the wine press. On the
  garden's borders flowers of all hues bloomed all the year round,
  arranged with neatest art. In the midst two fountains poured forth
  their waters, one flowing by artificial channels over all the
  garden, the other conducted through the courtyard of the palace,
  whence every citizen might draw his supplies.
  Ulysses stood gazing in admiration, unobserved himself, for the
  cloud which Minerva spread around him still shielded him. At length,
  having sufficiently observed the scene, he advanced with rapid step
  into the hall where the chiefs and senators were assembled, pouring
  libation to Mercury, whose worship followed the evening meal. Just
  then Minerva dissolved the cloud and disclosed him to the assembled
  chiefs. Advancing to the place where the queen sat, he knelt at her
  feet and implored her favour and assistance to enable him to return to
  his native country. Then withdrawing, he seated himself in the
  manner of suppliants, at the hearth side.
  For a time none spoke. At last an aged statesman, addressing the
  king, said, "It is not fit that a stranger who asks our hospitality
  should be kept waiting in suppliant guise, none welcoming him. Let him
  therefore be led to a seat among us and supplied with food and
  wine." At these words the king rising gave his hand to Ulysses and led
  him to a seat, displacing thence his own son to make room for the
  stranger. Food and wine were set before him and he ate and refreshed
  himself.
  The king then dismissed his guests, notifying them that the next day
  he would call them to council to consider what had best be done for
  the stranger.
  When the guests had departed and Ulysses was left alone with the
  king and queen, the queen asked him who he was and whence he came, and
  (recognizing the clothes which he wore as those which her maidens
  and herself had made) from whom he received those garments. He told
  them of his residence in Calypso's isle and his departure thence; of
  the wreck of his raft, his escape by swimming, and of the relief
  afforded by the princess. The parents heard approvingly, and the
  king promised to furnish a ship in which his guest might return to his
  own land.
  The next day the assembled chiefs confirmed the promise of the king.
  A bark was prepared and a crew of stout rowers selected, and all
  betook themselves to the palace, where a bounteous repast was
  provided. After the feast the king proposed that the young men
  should show their guest their proficiency in manly sports, and all
  went forth to the arena for games of running, wrestling, and other
  exercises. After all had done their best, Ulysses being challenged
  to show what he could do, at first declined, but being taunted by
  one of the youths, seized a quoit of weight far heavier than any of
  the Phaeacians had thrown, and sent it farther than the utmost throw
  of theirs. All were astonished, and viewed their guest with greatly
  increased respect.
  After the games they returned to the hall, and the herald led in
  Demodocus, the blind bard,

  "...Dear to the Muse,
  Who yet appointed him both good and ill,
  Took from his sight, but gave him strains divine."

  He took for his theme the "Wooden Horse," by means of which the
  Greeks found entrance into Troy. Apollo inspired him, and he sang so
  feelingly the terrors and the exploits of that eventful time that
  all were delighted, but Ulysses was moved to tears. Observing which,
  Alcinous, when the song was done, demanded of him why at the mention
  of Troy his sorrows awaked. Had he lost there a father, or brother, or
  any dear friend? Ulysses replied by announcing himself by his true
  name, and at their request, recounted the adventures which had
  befallen him since his departure from Troy. This narrative raised
  the sympathy and admiration of the Phaeacians for their guest to the
  highest pitch. The king proposed that all the chiefs should present
  him with a gift, himself setting the example. They obeyed, and vied
  with one another in loading the illustrious stranger with costly
  gifts.
  The next day Ulysses set sail in the Phaeacian vessel, and in a
  short time arrived safe at Ithaca, his own island. When the vessel
  touched the strand he was asleep. The mariners, without waking him,
  carried him on shore, and landed with him the chest containing his
  presents, and then sailed away.
  Neptune was so displeased at the conduct of the Phaeacians in thus
  rescuing Ulysses from his hands that on the return of the vessel to
  port he transformed it into a rock, right opposite the mouth of the
  harbour.
  Homer's description of the ships of the Phaeacians has been
  thought to look like an anticipation of the wonders of modern steam
  navigation. Alcinous says to Ulysses,

  "Say from what city, from what regions tossed,
  And what inhabitants those regions boast?
  So shalt thou quickly reach the realm assigned,
  In wondrous ships, self-moved, instinct with mind;
  No helm secures their course, no pilot guides;
  Like man intelligently they plough the tides,
  Conscious of every coast and every bay
  That lies beneath the sun's all-seeing ray."
  Odyssey, Book VIII.

  Lord Carlisle, in his "Diary in the Turkish and Greek Waters,"
  thus speaks of Corfu, which he considers to be the ancient Phaeacian
  island:
  "The sites explain the 'Odyssey.' The temple of the sea-god could
  not have been more fitly placed, upon a grassy platform of the most
  elastic turf, on the brow of a crag commanding the harbour, and
  channel, and ocean. Just at the entrance of the inner harbour there is
  a picturesque rock with a small convent perched upon it, which by
  one legend is the transformed pinnace of Ulysses.
  "Almost the only river in the island is just at the proper
  distance from the probable site of the city and palace of the king, to
  justify the princess Nausicaa having had resort to her chariot and
  to luncheon when she went with the maidens of the court to wash
  their garments."
