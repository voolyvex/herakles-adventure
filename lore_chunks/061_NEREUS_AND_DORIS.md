NEREUS AND DORIS
  Nereus and Doris were the parents of the Nereids, the most
  celebrated of whom were Amphitrite, Thetis, the mother of Achilles,
  and Galatea, who was loved by the Cyclops Polyphemus: Nereus was
  distinguished for his knowledge and his love of truth and justice,
  whence he was termed an elder; the gift of prophecy was also
  assigned to him.
