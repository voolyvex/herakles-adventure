OLYMPIC AND OTHER GAMES
  It seems not inappropriate to mention here the other celebrated
  national games of the Greeks. The first and most distinguished were
  the Olympic, founded, it was said, by Jupiter himself. They were
  celebrated at Olympia in Elis. Vast numbers of spectators flocked to
  them from every part of Greece, and from Asia, Africa and Sicily. They
  were repeated every fifth year in midsummer, and continued five
  days. They gave rise to the custom of reckoning time and dating events
  by Olympiads. The first Olympiad is generally considered as
  corresponding with the year 776 B.C. The Pythian games were celebrated
  in the vicinity of Delphi, the Isthmian on the Corinthian Isthmus, the
  Nemean at Nemea, a city of Argolis.
  The exercises in these games were of five sorts: running, leaping,
  wrestling, throwing the quoit, and hurling the javelin, or boxing.
  Besides these exercises of bodily strength and agility there were
  contests in music, poetry and eloquence. Thus these games furnished
  poets, musicians and authors the best opportunities to present their
  productions to the public, and the fame of the victors was diffused
  far and wide.
