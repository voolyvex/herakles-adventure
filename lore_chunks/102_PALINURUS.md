PALINURUS
  After touching at the island of Sicily, where Acestes, a prince of
  Trojan lineage, bore sway, who gave them a hospitable reception, the
  Trojans re-embarked, and held on their course for Italy. Venus now
  interceded with Neptune to allow her son at last to attain the
  wished-for goal and find an end of his perils on the deep. Neptune
  consented, stipulating only for one life as a ransom for the rest. The
  victim was Palinurus, the pilot. As he sat watching the stars, with
  his hand on the helm, Somnus sent by Neptune approached in the guise
  of Phorbas and said: "Palinurus, the breeze is fair, the water smooth,
  and the ship sails steadily on her course. Lie down awhile and take
  needful rest. I will stand at the helm in your place." Palinurus
  replied, "Tell me not of smooth seas or favouring winds,- me who
  have seen so much of their treachery. Shall I trust AEneas to the
  chances of the weather and the winds?" And he continued to grasp the
  helm and to keep his eyes fixed on the stars. But Somnus waved over
  him a branch moistened with Lethaean dew, and his eyes closed in spite
  of all his efforts. Then Somnus pushed him overboard and he fell:
  but keeping his hold upon the helm, it came away with him. Neptune was
  mindful of his promise and kept the ship on her track without helm
  or pilot, till AEneas discovered his loss, and, sorrowing deeply for
  his faithful steersman, took charge of the ship himself.

  There is a beautiful allusion to the story of Palinurus in Scott's
  "Marmion," Introduction to Canto I., where the poet, speaking of the
  recent death of William Pitt, says:

  "O, think how, to his latest day,
  When death just hovering claimed his prey,
  With Palinure's unaltered mood,
  Firm at his dangerous post he stood;
  Each call for needful rest repelled,
  With dying hand the rudder held,
  Till in his fall, with fateful sway,
  The steerage of the realm gave way."

  The ships at last reached the shores of Italy, and joyfully did
  the adventurers leap to land. While his people were employed in making
  their encampment AEneas sought the abode of the Sibyl. It was a cave
  connected with a temple and grove, sacred to Apollo and Diana. While
  AEneas contemplated the scene, the Sibyl accosted him. She seemed to
  know his errand, and under the influence of the deity of the place,
  burst forth in a prophetic strain, giving dark intimations of
  labours and perils through which he was destined to make his way to
  final success. She closed with the encouraging words which have become
  proverbial: "Yield not to disasters, but press onward the more
  bravely."* AEneas replied that he had prepared himself for whatever
  might await him. He had but one request to make. Having been
  directed in a dream to seek the abode of the dead in order to confer
  with his father, Anchises, to receive from him a revelation of his
  future fortunes and those of his race, he asked her assistance to
  enable him to accomplish the task. The Sibyl replied, "The descent
  to Avernus is easy: the gate of Pluto stands open night and day; but
  to retrace one's steps and return to the upper air, that is the
  toil, that the difficulty."*(2) She instructed him to seek in the
  forest a tree on which grew a golden branch. This branch was to be
  plucked off and borne as a gift to Proserpine, and if fate was
  propitious it would yield to the hand and quit its parent trunk, but
  otherwise no force could rend it away. If torn away, another would
  succeed.*(3)

  AEneas followed the directions of the Sibyl. His mother, Venus, sent
  two of her doves to fly before him and show him the way, and by
  their assistance he found the tree, plucked the branch, and hastened
  back with it to the Sibyl.
