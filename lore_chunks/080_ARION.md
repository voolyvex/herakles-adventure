ARION
  Arion was a famous musician, and dwelt at the court of Periander,
  king of Corinth, with whom he was a great favourite. There was to be a
  musical contest in Sicily, and Arion longed to compete for the
  prize, He told his wish to Periander, who besought him like a
  brother to give up the thought. "Pray stay with me," he said, "and
  be contented. He who strives to win may lose." Arion answered, "A
  wandering life best suits the free heart of a poet. The talent which a
  god bestowed on me, I would fain make a source of pleasure to
  others. And if I win the prize, how will the enjoyment of it be
  increased by the consciousness of my widespread fame!" He went, won
  the prize, and embarked with his wealth in a Corinthian ship for home.
  On the second morning after setting sail, the wind breathed mild and
  fair. "O Periander," he exclaimed, "dismiss your fears! Soon shall you
  forget them in my embrace. With what lavish offerings will we
  display our gratitude to the gods, and how merry will we be at the
  festal board!" The wind and sea continued propitious. Not a cloud
  dimmed the firmament. He had not trusted too much to the ocean- but he
  had to man. He overheard the seamen exchanging hints with one another,
  and found they were plotting to possess themselves of his treasure.
  Presently they surrounded him loud and mutinous, and said, "Arion, you
  must die! If you would have a grave on shore, yield yourself to die on
  this spot; but if otherwise, cast yourself into the sea." "Will
  nothing satisfy you but my life?" said he. "Take my gold, and welcome,
  I willingly buy my life at that price." "No, no; we cannot spare
  you. Your life would be too dangerous to us. Where could we go to
  escape from Periander, if he should know that you had been robbed by
  us? Your gold would be of little use to us, if, on returning home,
  we could never more be free from fear." "Grant me, then," said he,
  "a last request, since nought will avail to save my life, that I may
  die, as I have lived, as becomes a bard. When I shall have sung my
  death song, and my harp-strings shall have ceased to vibrate, then I
  will bid farewell to life, and yield uncomplaining to my fate." This
  prayer, like the others, would have been unheeded,- they thought
  only of their booty,- but to hear so famous a musician, that moved
  their rude hearts. "Suffer me," he added, "to arrange my dress. Apollo
  will not favour me unless I be clad in my minstrel garb."
  He clothed his well-proportioned limbs in gold and purple fair to
  see, his tunic fell around him in graceful folds, jewels adorned his
  arms, his brow was crowned with a golden wreath, and over his neck and
  shoulders flowed his hair perfumed with odours. His left hand held the
  lyre, his right the ivory wand with which he struck its chords. Like
  one inspired, he seemed to drink the morning air and glitter in the
  morning ray. The seamen gazed with admiration. He strode forward to
  the vessel's side and looked down into the deep blue sea. Addressing
  his lyre, he sang, "Companion of my voice, come with me to the realm
  of shades. Though Cerberus may growl, we know the power of song can
  tame his rage. Ye heroes of Elysium, who have passed the darkling
  flood,- ye happy souls, soon shall I join your band. Yet can ye
  relieve my grief? Alas, I leave my friend behind me. Thou, who didst
  find thy Eurydice, and lose her again as soon as found; when she had
  vanished like a dream, how didst thou hate the cheerful light! I
  must away, but I will not fear. The gods look down upon us. Ye who
  slay me unoffending, when I am no more, your time of trembling shall
  come. Ye Nereids, receive your guest, who throws himself upon your
  mercy!" So saying, he sprang into the deep sea. The waves covered him,
  and the seamen held on their way, fancying themselves safe from all
  danger of detection.
  But the strains of his music had drawn round him the inhabitants
  of the deep to listen, and Dolphins followed the ship as if chained by
  a spell. While he struggled in the waves, a Dolphin offered him his
  back, and carried him mounted thereon safe to shore. At the spot where
  he landed, a monument of brass was afterwards erected upon the rocky
  shore, to preserve the memory of the event.
  When Arion and the dolphin parted, each to his own element, Arion
  thus poured forth his thanks: "Farewell, thou faithful, friendly fish!
  Would that I could reward thee; but thou canst not wend with me, nor I
  with thee. Companionship we may not have. May Galatea, queen of the
  deep, accord thee her favour, and thou, proud of the burden, draw
  her chariot over the smooth mirror of the deep."
  Arion hastened from the shore, and soon saw before him the towers of
  Corinth. He journeyed on, harp in hand, singing as he went, full of
  love and happiness, forgetting his losses, and mindful only of what
  remained, his friend and his lyre. He entered the hospitable halls,
  and was soon clasped in the embrace of Periander. "I come back to
  thee, my friend," he said. "The talent which a god bestowed has been
  the delight of thousands, but false knaves have stripped me of my
  well-earned treasure; yet I retain the consciousness of widespread
  fame." Then he told Periander all the wonderful events that had
  befallen him, who heard him with amazement. "Shall such wickedness
  triumph?" said he. "Then in vain is power lodged in my hands. That
  we may discover the criminals, you must remain here in concealment,
  and so they will approach without suspicion." When the ship. arrived
  in the harbour, he summoned the mariners before him. "Have you heard
  anything of Arion?" he inquired. "I anxiously look for his return."
  They replied, "We left him well and prosperous in Tarentum." As they
  said these words, Arion stepped forth and faced them. His
  well-proportioned limbs were arrayed in gold and purple fair to see,
  his tunic fell around him in graceful folds, jewels adorned his
  arms, his brow was crowned with a golden wreath, and over his neck and
  shoulders flowed his hair perfumed with odours; his left hand held the
  lyre, his right the ivory wand with which he struck its chords. They
  fell prostrate at his feet, as if a lightning bolt had struck them.
  "We meant to murder him, and he has become a god. O Earth, open and
  receive us!" Then Periander spoke. "He lives, the master of the lay!
  Kind Heaven protects the poet's life. As for you, I invoke not the
  spirit of vengeance; Arion wishes not your blood. Ye slaves of
  avarice, begone! Seek some barbarous land, and never may aught
  beautiful delight your souls!"

  Spenser represents Arion, mounted on his dolphin, accompanying the
  train of Neptune and Amphitrite:

  "Then was there heard a most celestial sound
  Of dainty music which did next ensue,
  And, on the floating waters as enthroned,
  Arion with his harp unto him drew
  The ears and hearts of all that goodly crew;
  Even when as yet the dolphin which him bore
  Through the AEgean Seas from pirates' view,
  Stood still, by him astonished at his lore,
  And all the raging seas for joy forgot to roar."

  Byron, in his "Childe Harold," Canto II., alludes to the story of
  Arion, when, describing his voyage, he represents one of the seamen
  making music to entertain the rest:

  "The moon is up; by Heaven a lovely eve!
  Long streams of light o'er dancing waves expand;
  Now lads on shore may sigh and maids believe;
  Such be our fate when we return to land!
  Meantime some rude Arion's restless hand
  Wakes the brisk harmony that sailors love;
  A circle there of merry listeners stand,
  Or to some well-known measure featly move
  Thoughtless as if on shore they still were free to rove."
