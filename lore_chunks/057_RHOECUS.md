RHOECUS
  The Hamadryads could appreciate services as well as punish injuries.
  The story of Rhoecus proves this. Rhoecus, happening to see an oak
  just ready to fall, ordered his servants to prop it up. The nymph, who
  had been on the point of perishing with the tree, came and expressed
  her gratitude to him for having saved her life and bade him ask what
  reward he would. Rhoecus boldly asked her love and the nymph yielded
  to his desire. She at the same time charged him to be constant and
  told him that a bee should be her messenger and let him know when
  she would admit his society. One time the bee came to Rhoecus when
  he was playing at draughts and he carelessly brushed it away. This
  so incensed the nymph that she deprived him of sight.

  Our countryman, J. R. Lowell, has taken this story for the subject
  of one of his shorter poems. He introduces it thus:

  "Hear now this fairy legend of old Greece,
  As full of freedom, youth and beauty still,
  As the immortal freshness of that grace
  Carved for all ages on some Attic frieze."
