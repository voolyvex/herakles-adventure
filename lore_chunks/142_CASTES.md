CASTES
  The division of the Hindus into classes or castes, with fixed
  occupations, existed from the earliest times. It is supposed by some
  to have been founded upon conquest, the first three castes being
  composed of a foreign race, who subdued the natives of the country and
  reduced them to an inferior caste. Others trace it to the fondness
  of perpetuating, by descent from father to son, certain offices or
  occupations.
  The Hindu tradition gives the following account of the origin of the
  various castes: At the creation Brahma resolved to give the earth
  inhabitants who should be direct emanations from his own body.
  Accordingly from his mouth came forth the eldest born, Brahma (the
  priest), to whom he confided the four Vedas; from his right arm issued
  Shatriya (the warrior), and from his left, the warrior's wife. His
  thighs produced Vaissyas, male and female (agriculturists and
  traders), and lastly from his feet sprang Sudras (mechanics and
  labourers).
  The four sons of Brahma, so significantly brought into the world,
  became the fathers of the human race, and heads of their respective
  castes. They were commanded to regard the four Vedas as containing all
  the rules of their faith, and all that was necessary to guide them
  in their religious ceremonies. They were also commanded to take rank
  in the order of their birth, the Brahmans uppermost, as having
  sprung from the head of Brahma.
  A strong line of demarcation is drawn between the first three castes
  and the Sudras. The former are allowed to receive instruction from the
  Vedas, which is not permitted to the Sudras. The Brahmans possess
  the privilege of teaching the Vedas, and were in former times in
  exclusive possession of all knowledge. Though the sovereign of the
  country was chosen from the Shatriya class, also called Rajputs, the
  Brahmans possessed the real power, and were the royal counsellors, the
  judges and magistrates of the country; their persons and property were
  inviolable; and though they committed the greatest crimes, they
  could only be banished from the kingdom. They were to be treated by
  sovereigns with the greatest respect, for "a Brahman, whether
  learned or ignorant, is a powerful divinity."
  When the Brahman arrives at years of maturity it becomes his duty to
  marry. He ought to be supported by the contributions of the rich,
  and not to be obliged to gain his subsistence by any laborious or
  productive occupation. But as all the Brahmans could not be maintained
  by the working classes of the community, it was found necessary to
  allow them to engage in productive employments.
  We need say little of the two intermediate classes, whose rank and
  privileges may be readily inferred from their occupations. The
  Sudras or fourth class are bound to servile attendance on the higher
  classes, especially the Brahmans, but they may follow mechanical
  occupations and practical arts, as painting and writing, or become
  traders or husbandmen. Consequently they sometimes grow rich, and it
  will also sometimes happen that Brahmans become poor. That fact
  works its usual consequence, and rich Sudras sometimes employ poor
  Brahmans in menial occupations.
  There is another class lower even than the Sudras, for it is not one
  of the original pure classes, but springs from an unauthorized union
  of individuals of different castes. These are the Pariahs, who are
  employed in the lowest services and treated with the utmost
  severity. They are compelled to do what no one else can do without
  pollution. They are not only considered unclean themselves, but they
  render unclean everything they touch. They are deprived of all civil
  rights, and stigmatized by particular laws regulating their mode of
  life, their houses, and their furniture. They are not allowed to visit
  the pagodas or temples of the other castes, but have their own pagodas
  and religious exercises. They are not suffered to enter the houses
  of the other castes; if it is done incautiously or from necessity, the
  place must be purified by religious ceremonies. They must not appear
  at public markets, and are confined to the use of particular wells,
  which they are obliged to surround with bones of animals, to warn
  others against using them. They dwell in miserable hovels, distant
  from cities and villages, and are under no restrictions in regard to
  food, which last is not a privilege, but a mark of ignominy, as if
  they were so degraded that nothing could pollute them. The three
  higher castes are prohibited entirely the use of flesh. The fourth
  is allowed to use all kinds except beef, but only the lowest caste
  is allowed every kind of food without restriction.
