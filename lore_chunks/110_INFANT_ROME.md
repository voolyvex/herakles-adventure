INFANT ROME
  When the solemnities were ended all moved towards the city. The
  king, bending with age, walked between his son and AEneas, taking
  the arm of one or the other of them, and with much variety of pleasing
  talk shortening the way. AEneas with delight looked and listened,
  observing all the beauties of the scene, and learning much of heroes
  renowned in ancient times. Evander said, "These extensive groves
  were once inhabited by fauns and nymphs, and a rude race of men who
  sprang from the trees themselves, and had neither laws not social
  culture. They knew not how to yoke the cattle nor raise a harvest, nor
  provide from present abundance for future want; but browsed like
  beasts upon the leafy boughs, or fed voraciously or their hunted prey.
  Such were they when Saturn, expelled from Olympus by his sons, came
  among them and drew together the fierce savages, formed them into
  society and gave them laws. Such peace and plenty ensued that men ever
  since have called his reign the golden age; but by degrees far other
  times succeeded, and the thirst of gold and the thirst of blood
  prevailed. The land was a prey to successive tyrants, till fortune and
  resistless destiny brought me hither, an exile from my native land,
  Arcadia."
  Having thus said, he showed him the Tarpeian rock, and the rude spot
  then overgrown with bushes where in after times the Capitol rose in
  all its magnificence. He next pointed to some dismantled walls, and
  said, "Here stood Janiculum, built by Janus, and there Saturnia, the
  town of Saturn." Such discourse brought them to the cottage of poor
  Evander, whence they saw the lowing herds roaming over the plain where
  now the proud and stately Forum stands. They entered, and a couch
  was spread for AEneas, well stuffed with leaves, and covered with
  the skin of a Libyan bear.
  Next morning, awakened by the dawn and the shrill song of birds
  beneath the eaves of his low mansion, old Evander rose. Clad in a
  tunic, and a panther's skin thrown over his shoulders, with sandals on
  his feet and his good sword girded to his side, he went forth to
  seek his guest. Two mastiffs followed him, his whole retinue and
  body guard. He found the hero attended by his faithful Achates, and,
  Pallas, soon joining them, the old king spoke thus:
  "Illustrious Trojan, it is but little we can do in so great a cause.
  Our state is feeble, hemmed in on one side by the river, on the
  other by the Rutulians. But I propose to ally you with a people
  numerous and rich, to whom fate has brought you at the propitious
  moment. The Etruscans hold the country beyond the river. Mezentius was
  their king, a monster of cruelty, who invented unheard-of torments
  to gratify his vengeance. He would fasten the dead to the living, hand
  to hand and face to face, and leave the wretched victims to die in
  that dreadful embrace. At length the people cast him out, him and
  his house. They burned his palace and slew his friends. He escaped and
  took refuge with Turnus, who protects him with arms. The Etruscans
  demand that he shall be given up to deserved punishment, and would ere
  now have attempted to enforce their demand; but the priests restrain
  them, telling them that it is the will of heaven that no native of the
  land shall guide them to victory, and that their destined leader
  must come from across the sea. They have offered the crown to me,
  but I am too old to undertake such great affairs, and my son is
  native-born, which precludes him from the choice. You, equally by
  birth and time of life, and fame in arms, pointed out by the gods,
  have but to appear to be hailed at once as their leader. With you I
  will join Pallas, my son, my only hope and comfort. Under you he shall
  learn the art of war, and strive to emulate your great exploits."
  Then the king ordered horses to be furnished for the Trojan
  chiefs, and AEneas, with a chosen band of followers and Pallas
  accompanying, mounted and took the way to the Etruscan city,* having
  sent back the rest of his party in the ships. AEneas and his band
  safely arrived at the Etruscan camp and were received with open arms
  by Tarchon and his countrymen.

  * The poet here inserts a famous line which is thought to imitate in
  its sound the galloping of horses. It may be thus translated: "Then
  struck the hoofs of the steeds on the ground with a four-footed
  trampling."- See Proverbial Expressions, no. 17.
