SAPPHO
  Sappho was a poetess who flourished in a very early age of Greek
  literature. Of her works few fragments remain, but they are enough
  to establish her claim to eminent poetical genius. The story of Sappho
  commonly alluded to is that she was passionately in love with a
  beautiful youth named Phaon, and failing to obtain a return of
  affection she threw herself from the promontory of Leucadia into the
  sea, under a superstition that those who should take that
  "Lover's-leap" would, if not destroyed, be cured of their love.

  Byron alludes to the story of Sappho in "Childe Harold," Canto II.:

  "Childe Harold sailed and passed the barren spot
  Where sad Penelope o'erlooked the wave,
  And onward viewed the mount, not yet forgot,
  The lover's refuge and the Lesbian's grave.
  Dark Sappho! could not verse immortal save
  That breast imbued with such immortal fire?

  "'Twas on a Grecian autumn's gentle eve
  Childe Harold hailed Leucadia's cape afar; etc.

  Those who wish to know more of Sappho and her "leap" are referred to
  the "Spectator," Nos. 223 and 229. See also Moore's "Evenings in
  Greece."
