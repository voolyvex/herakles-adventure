THE SIBYL
  As AEneas and the Sibyl pursued their way back to earth, he said
  to her, "Whether thou be a goddess or a mortal beloved of the gods, by
  me thou shalt always be held in reverence. When I reach the upper
  air I will cause a temple to be built to thy honour, and will myself
  bring offerings." "I am no goddess," said the Sibyl; "I have no
  claim to sacrifice or offering. I am mortal; yet if I could have
  accepted the love of Apollo I might have been immortal. He promised me
  the fulfilment of my wish, if I would consent to be his. I took a
  handful of sand, and holding it forth, said, 'Grant me to see as
  many birthdays as there are sand grains in my hand.' Unluckily I
  forgot to ask for enduring youth. This also he would have granted,
  could I have accepted his love, but offended at my refusal, he allowed
  me to grow old. My youth and youthful strength fled long ago. I have
  lived seven hundred years, and to equal the number of the
  sand-grains I have still to see three hundred springs and three
  hundred harvests. My body shrinks up as years increase, and in time, I
  shall be lost to sight, but my voice will remain, and future ages will
  respect my sayings."
  These concluding words of the Sibyl alluded to her prophetic
  power. In her cave she was accustomed to inscribe on leaves gathered
  from the trees the names and fates of individuals. The leaves thus
  inscribed were arranged in order within the cave, and might be
  consulted by her votaries. But if perchance at the opening of the door
  the wind rushed in and dispersed the leaves the Sibyl gave no aid in
  restoring them again, and the oracle was irreparably lost.
  The following legend of the Sibyl is fixed at a later date. In the
  reign of one of the Tarquins there appeared before the king a woman
  who offered him nine books for sale, The king refused to purchase
  them, whereupon the woman went away and burned three of the books, and
  returning offered the remaining books for the same price she had asked
  for the nine. The king again rejected them; but when the woman,
  after burning three books more, returned and asked for the three
  remaining the same price which she had before asked for the nine,
  his curiosity was excited, and he purchased the books. They were found
  to contain the destinies of the Roman state. They were kept in the
  temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, preserved in a stone chest, and allowed
  to be inspected only by special officers appointed for that duty, who,
  on great occasions, consulted them and interpreted their oracles to
  the people.
  There were various Sibyls; but the Cumaean Sibyl, of whom Ovid and
  Virgil write, is the most celebrated of them. Ovid's story of her life
  protracted to one thousand years may be intended to represent the
  various Sibyls as being only reappearances of one and the same
  individual.

  Young, in the "Night Thoughts," alludes to the Sibyl. Speaking of
  Worldly Wisdom, he says:

  "If future fate she plans 'tis all in leaves,
  Like Sibyl, unsubstantial, fleeting bliss;
  At the first blast it vanishes in air.
  As worldly schemes resemble Sibyl's leaves,
  The good man's days to Sibyl's books compare,
  The price still rising as in number less."
