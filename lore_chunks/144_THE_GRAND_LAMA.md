THE GRAND LAMA
  It is a doctrine alike of the Brahminical Hindus and of the Buddhist
  sect that the confinement of the human soul, an emanation of the
  divine spirit, in a human body, is a state of misery, and the
  consequence of frailties and sins committed during former
  existences. But they hold that some few individuals have appeared on
  this earth from time to time, not under the necessity of terrestrial
  existence, but who voluntarily descended to the earth to promote the
  welfare of mankind. These individuals have gradually assumed the
  character of reappearances of Buddha himself, in which capacity the
  line is continued till the present day, in the several Lamas of
  Thibet, China, and other countries where Buddhism prevails. In
  consequence of the victories of Gengis Khan and his successors, the
  Lama residing in Thibet was raised to the dignity of chief pontiff
  of the sect. A separate province was assigned to him as his own
  territory, and besides his spiritual dignity he became to a limited
  extent a temporal monarch. He is styled the Dalai Lama.
  The first Christian missionaries who proceeded to Thibet were
  surprised to find there in the heart of Asia a pontifical court and
  several other ecclesiastical institutions resembling those of the
  Roman Catholic church. They found convents for priests and nuns,
  also processions and forms of religious worship, attended with much
  pomp and splendour; and many were induced by these similarities to
  consider Lamaism as a sort of degenerated Christianity. It is not
  improbable that the Lamas derived some of these practices from the
  Nestorian Christians, who were settled in Tartary when Buddhism was
  introduced into Thibet.
