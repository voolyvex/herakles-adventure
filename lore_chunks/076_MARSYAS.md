MARSYAS
  Minerva invented the flute, and played upon it to the delight of all
  the celestial auditors; but the mischievous urchin Cupid having
  dared to laugh at the queer face which the goddess made while playing,
  Minerva threw the instrument indignantly away, and it fell down to
  earth and was found by Marsyas. He blew upon it, and drew from it such
  ravishing sounds that he was tempted to challenge Apollo himself to
  a musical contest. The god of course triumphed, and punished Marsyas
  by flaying him alive.
