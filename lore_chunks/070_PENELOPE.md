PENELOPE
  Penelope is another of those mythic heroines whose beauties were
  rather those of character and conduct than of person. She was the
  daughter of Icarius, a Spartan prince. Ulysses, king of Ithaca, sought
  her in marriage, and won her, over all competitors. When the moment
  came for the bride to leave her father's house, Icarius, unable to
  bear the thoughts of parting with his daughter, tried to persuade
  her to remain with him, and not accompany her husband to Ithaca.
  Ulysses gave Penelope her choice, to stay or go with him. Penelope
  made no reply, but dropped her veil over her face. Icarius urged her
  no further, but when she was gone erected a statue to Modesty on the
  spot where they parted.
  Ulysses and Penelope had not enjoyed their union more than a year
  when it was interrupted by the events which called Ulysses to the
  Trojan war. During his long absence, and when it was doubtful
  whether he still lived, and highly improbable that he would ever
  return, Penelope was importuned by numerous suitors, from whom there
  seemed no refuge but in choosing one of them for her husband.
  Penelope, however, employed every art to gain time, still hoping for
  Ulysses' return. One of her arts of delay was engaging in the
  preparation of a robe for the funeral canopy of Laertes, her husband's
  father. She pledged herself to make her choice among the suitors
  when the robe was finished. During the day she worked at the robe, but
  in the night she undid the work of the day. This is the famous
  Penelope's web, which is used as a proverbial expression for
  anything which is perpetually doing but never done. The rest of
  Penelope's history will be told when we give an account of her
  husband's adventures.
