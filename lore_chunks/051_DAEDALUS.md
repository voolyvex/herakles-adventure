DAEDALUS
  The labyrinth from which Theseus escaped by means of the clew of
  Ariadne was built by Daedalus, a most skilful artificer. It was an
  edifice with numberless winding passages and turnings opening into one
  another, and seeming to have neither beginning nor end, like the river
  Maeander, which returns on itself, and flows now onward, now backward,
  in its course to the sea. Daedalus built the labyrinth for King Minos,
  but afterwards lost the favour of the king, and was shut up in a
  tower. He contrived to make his escape from his prison, but could
  not leave the island by sea, as the king kept strict watch on all
  the vessels, and permitted none to sail without being carefully
  searched. "Minos may control the land and sea," said Daedalus, "but
  not the regions of the air. I will try that way." So he set to work to
  fabricate wings for himself and his young son Icarus. He wrought
  feathers together, beginning with the smallest and adding larger, so
  as to form an increasing surface. The larger ones he secured with
  thread and the smaller with wax, and gave the whole a gentle curvature
  like the wings of a bird. Icarus, the boy, stood and looked on,
  sometimes running to gather up the feathers which the wind had blown
  away, and then handling the wax and working it over with his
  fingers, by his play impeding his father in his labours. When at
  last the work was done, the artist, waving his wings, found himself
  buoyed upward, and hung suspended, poising himself on the beaten
  air. He next equipped his son in the same manner and taught him how to
  fly, as a bird tempts her young ones from the lofty nest into the air.
  When all was prepared for flight he said, "Icarus, my son, I charge
  you to keep at a moderate height, for if you fly too low the damp will
  clog your wings, and if too high the heat will melt them. Keep near me
  and you will be safe." While he gave him these instructions and fitted
  the wings to his shoulders, the face of the father was wet with tears,
  and his hands trembled. He kissed the boy, not knowing that it was for
  the last time. Then rising on his wings, he flew off, encouraging
  him to follow, and looked back from his own flight to see how his
  son managed his wings. As they flew the ploughman stopped his work
  to gaze, aid the shepherd leaned on his staff and watched them,
  astonished at the sight, and thinking they were gods who could thus
  cleave the air.
  They passed Samos and Delos on the left and Lebynthos on the
  right, when the boy, exulting in his career, began to leave the
  guidance of his companion and soar upward as if to reach heaven. The
  nearness of the blazing sun softened the wax which held the feathers
  together, and they came off. He fluttered with his arms, but no
  feathers remained to hold the air. While his mouth uttered cries to
  his father it was submerged in the blue waters of the sea which
  thenceforth was called by his name. His father cried, "Icarus, Icarus,
  where are you?" At last he saw the feathers floating on the water, and
  bitterly lamenting his own arts, he buried the body and called the
  land Icaria in memory of his child. Daedalus arrived safe in Sicily,
  where he built a temple to Apollo, and hung up his wings, an
  offering to the god.
  Daedalus was so proud of his achievements that he could not bear the
  idea of a rival. His sister had placed her son Perdix under his charge
  to be taught the mechanical arts. He was an apt scholar and gave
  striking evidences of ingenuity. Walking on the seashore he picked
  up the spine of a fish. Imitating it, he took a piece of iron and
  notched it on the edge, and thus invented the saw. He, put two
  pieces of iron together, connecting them at one end with a rivet,
  and sharpening the other ends, and made a pair of compasses.
  Daedalus was so envious of his nephew's performances that he took an
  opportunity, when they were together one day on the top of a high
  tower to push him off. But Minerva, who favours ingenuity, saw him
  falling, and arrested his fate by changing him into a bird called
  after his name, the Partridge. This bird does not build his nest in
  the trees, nor take lofty flights, but nestles in the hedges, and
  mindful of his fall, avoids high places.

  The death of Icarus is told in the following lines by Darwin:

  "...with melting wax and loosened strings
  Sunk hapless Icarus on unfaithful wings;
  Headlong he rushed through the affrighted air,
  With limbs distorted and dishevelled hair;
  His scattered plumage danced upon the wave,
  And sorrowing Nereids decked his watery grave;
  O'er his pale corse their pearly sea-flowers shed,
  And strewed with crimson moss his marble bed;
  Struck in their coral towers the passing bell,
  And wide in ocean tolled his echoing knell."
