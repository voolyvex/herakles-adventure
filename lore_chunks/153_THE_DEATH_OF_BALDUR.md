THE DEATH OF BALDUR
  BALDUR the Good, having been tormented with terrible dreams
  indicating that his life was in peril, told them to the assembled
  gods, who resolved to conjure all things to avert from him the
  threatened danger. Then Frigga, the wife of Odin, exacted an oath from
  fire and water, from iron and all other metals, from stones, trees,
  diseases, beasts, birds, poisons, and creeping things, that none of
  them would do any harm to Baldur. Odin, not satisfied with all this,
  and feeling alarmed for the fate of his son, determined to consult the
  prophetess Angerbode, a giantess, mother of Fenris, Hela, and the
  Midgard serpent. She was dead, and Odin was forced to seek her in
  Hela's dominions. This Descent of Odin forms the subject of Gray's
  fine ode beginning:

  "Uprose the king of men with speed
  And saddled straight his coal-black steed."

  But the other gods, feeling that what Frigga had done was quite
  sufficient, amused themselves with using Baldur as a mark, some
  hurling darts at him, some stones, while others hewed at him with
  their swords and battle-axes; for do what they would, none of them
  could harm him. And this became a favourite pastime with them and
  was regarded as an honour shown to Baldur. But when Loki beheld the
  scene he was sorely vexed that Baldur was not hurt. Assuming,
  therefore, the shape of a woman, he went to Fensalir, the mansion of
  Frigga. That goddess, when she saw the pretended woman, inquired of
  her if she knew what the gods were doing at their meetings. She
  replied that they were throwing darts and stones at Baldur, without
  being able to hurt him. "Ay," said Frigga, "neither stones, nor
  sticks, nor anything else can hurt Baldur, for I have exacted an
  oath from all of them." "What," exclaimed the woman, "have all
  things sworn to spare Baldur?" "All things," replied Frigga, "except
  one little shrub that grows on the eastern side of Valhalla, and is
  called Mistletoe, and which I thought too young and feeble to crave an
  oath from."
  As soon as Loki heard this he went away, and resuming his natural
  shape, cut off the mistletoe, and repaired to the place where the gods
  were assembled. There he found Hodur standing apart, without partaking
  of the sports, on account of his blindness, and going up to him, said,
  "Why dost thou not also throw something at Baldur?"
  "Because I am blind," answered Hodur, "and see not where Baldur
  is, and have, moreover, nothing to throw."
  "Come, then," said Loki, "do like the rest, and show honour to
  Baldur by throwing this twig at him, and I will direct thy arm towards
  the place where he stands."
  Hodur then took the mistletoe, and under the guidance of Loki,
  darted it at Baldur, who, pierced through and through, fell down
  lifeless. Surely never was there witnessed, either among gods or
  men, a more atrocious deed than this. When Baldur fell, the gods
  were struck speechless with horror, and then they looked at each other
  and all were of one mind to lay hands on him who had done the deed,
  but they were obliged to delay their vengeance out of respect for
  the sacred place where they were assembled. They gave vent to their
  grief by loud lamentations. When the gods came to themselves, Frigga
  asked who among them wished to gain all her love and good will. "For
  this," said she, "shall he have who will ride to Hel and offer Hela
  a ransom if she will let Baldur return to Asgard." Whereupon Hermod,
  surnamed the Nimble, the son of Odin, offered to undertake the
  journey. Odin's horse, Sleipnir, which has eight legs and can outrun
  the wind, was then led forth, on which Hermod mounted and galloped
  away on his mission. For the space of nine days and as many nights
  he rode through deep glens so dark that he could not discern anything,
  until he arrived at the river Gyoll, which he passed over on a
  bridge covered with glittering gold. The maiden who kept the bridge
  asked him his name and lineage, telling him that the day before five
  bands of dead persons had ridden over the bridge, and did not shake it
  as much as he alone. "But," she added, "thou hast not death's hue on
  thee; why then ridest thou here on the way to Hel?"
  "I ride to Hel," answered Hermod, "to seek Baldur. Hast thou
  perchance seen him pass this way?"
  She replied, "Baldur hath ridden over Gyoll's bridge, and yonder
  lieth the way he took to the abodes of death."
  Hermod pursued his journey until he came to the barred gates of Hel.
  Here he alighted, girthed his saddle tighter, and remounting clapped
  both spurs to his horse, who cleared the gate by a tremendous leap
  without touching it. Hermod then rode on to the palace, where he found
  his brother Baldur occupying the most distinguished seat in the
  hall, and passed the night in his company. The next morning he
  besought Hela to let Baldur ride home with him, assuring her that
  nothing but lamentations were to be heard among the gods. Hela
  answered that it should now be tried whether Baldur was so beloved
  as he was said to be. "If, therefore," she added, "all things in the
  world, both living and lifeless, weep for him, then shall he return to
  life; but if any one thing speak against him or refuse to weep, he
  shall be kept in Hel."
  Hermod then rode back to Asgard and gave an account of all he had
  heard and witnessed.
  The gods upon this despatched messengers throughout the world to beg
  everything to weep in order that Baldur might be delivered from Hel.
  All things very willingly complied with this request, both men and
  every other living being, as well as earths, and stones, and trees,
  and metals, just as we have all seen these things weep when they are
  brought from a cold place into a hot one. As the messengers were
  returning, they found an old hag named Thaukt sitting in a cavern, and
  begged her to weep Baldur out of Hel. But she answered:

  "Thaukt will wail
  With dry tears
  Baldur's bale-fire.
  Let Hela keep her own."

  It was strongly suspected that this hag was no other than Loki
  himself, who never ceased to work evil among gods and men. So Baldur
  was prevented from coming back to Asgard.*

  Drapa," upon the subject of Baldur's death.
