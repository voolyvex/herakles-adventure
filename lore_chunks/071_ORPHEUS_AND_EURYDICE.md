ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE
  ORPHEUS was the son of Apollo and the Muse Calliope. He was
  presented by his father with a lyre and taught to play upon it,
  which he did to such perfection that nothing could withstand the charm
  of his music. Not only his fellow-mortals, but wild beasts were
  softened by his strains, and gathering round him laid by their
  fierceness, and stood entranced with his lay. Nay, the very trees
  and rocks were sensible to the charm. The former crowded round him and
  the latter relaxed somewhat of their hardness, softened by his notes.
  Hymen had been called to bless with his presence the nuptials of
  Orpheus with Eurydice; but though he attended, he brought no happy
  omens with him. His very torch smoked and brought tears into their
  eyes. In coincidence with such prognostics, Eurydice, shortly after
  her marriage, while wandering with the nymphs, her companions, was
  seen by the shepherd Aristaeus, who was struck by her beauty and
  made advances to her. She fled, and in flying trod upon a snake in the
  grass, was bitten in the foot, and died. Orpheus sang his grief to all
  who breathed the upper air, both gods and men, and finding it all
  unavailing resolved to seek his wife in the regions of the dead. He
  descended by a cave situated on the side of the promontory of Taenarus
  and arrived at the Stygian realm. He passed through crowds of ghosts
  and presented himself before the throne of Pluto and Proserpine.
  Accompanying the words with the lyre, he sung, "O deities of the
  under-world, to whom all we who live must come, hear my words, for
  they are true. I come not to spy out the secrets of Tartarus, nor to
  try my strength against the three-headed dog with snaky hair who
  guards the entrance. I come to seek my wife, whose opening years the
  poisonous viper's fang has brought to an untimely end. Love has led me
  here, Love, a god all powerful with us who dwell on the earth, and, if
  old traditions say true, not less so here. I implore you by these
  abodes full of terror, these realms of silence and uncreated things,
  unite again the thread of Eurydice's life. We all are destined to you,
  and sooner or later must pass to your domain. She too, when she
  shall have filled her term of life, will rightly be yours. But till
  then grant her to me, I beseech you. If you deny me, I cannot return
  alone; you shall triumph in the death of us both."
  As he sang these tender strains, the very ghosts shed tears.
  Tantalus, in spite of his thirst, stopped for a moment his efforts for
  water, Ixion's wheel stood still, the vulture ceased to tear the
  giant's liver, the daughters of Danaus rested from their task of
  drawing water in a sieve, and Sisyphus sat on his rock to listen. Then
  for the first time, it is said, the cheeks of the Furies were wet with
  tears. Proserpine could not resist, and Pluto himself gave way.
  Eurydice was called. She came from among the new-arrived ghosts,
  limping with her wounded foot. Orpheus was permitted to take her
  away with him on one condition, that he should not turn around to look
  at her till they should have reached the upper air. Under this
  condition they proceeded on their way, he leading, she following,
  through passages dark and steep, in total silence, till they had
  nearly reached the outlet into the cheerful upper world, when Orpheus,
  in a moment of forgetfulness, to assure himself that she was still
  following, cast a glance behind him, when instantly she was borne
  away. Stretching out their arms to embrace each other, they grasped
  only the air! Dying now a second time, she yet cannot reproach her
  husband, for how can she blame his impatience to behold her?
  "Farewell," she said, "a last farewell,"- and was hurried away, so
  fast that the sound hardly reached his ears.
  Orpheus endeavoured to follow her, and besought permission to return
  and try once more for her release; but the stern ferryman repulsed him
  and refused passage. Seven days he lingered about the brink, without
  food or sleep; then bitterly accusing of cruelty the powers of Erebus,
  he sang his complaints to the rocks and mountains, melting the
  hearts of tigers and moving the oaks from their stations. He held
  himself aloof from womankind, dwelling constantly on the
  recollection of his sad mischance. The Thracian maidens tried their
  best to captivate him, but he repulsed their advances. They bore
  with him as long as they could; but finding him insensible one day,
  excited by the rites of Bacchus, one of them exclaimed, "See yonder
  our despiser!" and threw at him her javelin. The weapon, as soon as it
  came within the sound of his lyre, fell harmless at his feet. So did
  also the stones that they threw at him. But the women raised a
  scream and drowned the voice of the music, and then the missiles
  reached him and soon were stained with his blood. The maniacs tore him
  limb from limb, and threw his head and his lyre into the river Hebrus,
  down which they floated, murmuring sad music, to which the shores
  responded a plaintive symphony. The Muses gathered up the fragments of
  his body and buried them at Libethra, where the nightingale is said to
  sing over his grave more sweetly than in any other part of Greece. His
  lyre was placed by Jupiter among the stars. His shade passed a
  second time to Tartarus. where he sought out his Eurydice and embraced
  her with eager arms. They roam the happy fields together now,
  sometimes he leading, sometimes she; and Orpheus gazes as much as he
  will upon her, no longer incurring a penalty for a thoughtless glance.

  The story of Orpheus has furnished Pope with an illustration of
  the power of music, for his "Ode for St. Cecilia's Day." The following
  stanza relates the conclusion of the story:

  "But soon, too soon the lover turns his eyes;
  Again she falls, again she dies, she dies!
  How wilt thou now the fatal sisters move?
  No crime was thine, if 'tis no crime to love.
  Now under hanging mountains,
  Beside the falls of fountains,
  Or where Hebrus wanders,
  Rolling in meanders,
  All alone,
  He makes his moan,
  And calls her ghost,
  For ever, ever, ever lost!
  Now with furies surrounded,
  Despairing, confounded,
  He trembles, he glows,
  Amidst Rhodope's snows.
  See, wild as the winds o'er the desert he flies;
  Hark! Haemus resounds with the Bacchanals' cries.
  Ah, see, he dies!
  Yet even in death Eurydice he sung,
  Eurydice still trembled on his tongue:
  Eurydice the woods
  Eurydice the floods
  Eurydice the rocks and hollow mountains rung."

  The superior melody of the nightingale's song over the grave of
  Orpheus is alluded to by Southey in his "Thalaba":

  "Then on his ear what sounds
  Of harmony arose!
  Far music and the distance-mellowed song
  From bowers of merriment;
  The waterfall remote;
  The murmuring of the leafy groves;
  The single nightingale
  Perched in the rosier by, so richly toned,
  That never from that most melodious bird
  Singing a love song to his brooding mate,
  Did Thracian shepherd by the grave
  Of Orpheus hear a sweeter melody,
  Though there the spirit of the sepulchre
  All his own power infuse, to swell
  The incense that he loves."
