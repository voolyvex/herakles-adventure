THE PYGMIES
  The Pygmies were a nation of dwarfs, so called from a Greek word
  which means the cubit or measure of about thirteen inches, which was
  said to be the height of these people. They lived near the sources
  of the Nile, or according to others, in India. Homer tells us that the
  cranes used to migrate every winter to the Pygmies' country, and their
  appearance was the signal of bloody warfare to the puny inhabitants,
  who had to take up arms to defend their cornfields against the
  rapacious strangers. The Pygmies and their enemies the Cranes form the
  subject of several works of art.
  Later writers tell of an army of Pygmies which finding Hercules
  asleep, made preparations to attack him, as if they were about to
  attack a city. But the hero, awaking, laughed at the little
  warriors, wrapped some of them up in his lion's skin, and carried them
  to Eurystheus.

  Milton uses the Pygmies for a simile, "Paradise Lost," Book I.:

  "...like that Pygmaean race
  Beyond the Indian mount, of fairy elves
  Whose midnight revels by a forest side,
  Or fountain, some belated peasant sees
  (Or dreams he sees), while overhead the moon
  Sits arbitress, and nearer to the earth
  Wheels her pale course; they on their mirth and dance
  Intent, with jocund music charm his ear.
  At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds."
