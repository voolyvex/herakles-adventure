THE DRUIDS
  THE Druids were the priests or ministers of religion among the
  ancient Celtic nations in Gaul, Britain, and Germany. Our
  information respecting them is borrowed from notices in the Greek
  and Roman writers; compared with the remains of Welsh and Gaelic
  poetry still extant.
  The Druids combined the functions of the priest, the magistrate, the
  scholar, and the physician. They stood to the people of the Celtic
  tribes in a relation closely analogous to that in which the Brahmans
  of India, the Magi of Persia, and the priests of the Egyptians stood
  to the people respectively by whom they were revered.
  The Druids taught the existence of one god, to whom they gave a name
  "Be' al," which Celtic antiquaries tell us means "the life of
  everything," or "the source of all beings," and which seems to have
  affinity with the Phoenician Baal. What renders this affinity more
  striking is that the Druids as well as the Phoenicians identified
  this, their supreme deity, with the Sun. Fire was regarded as a symbol
  of the divinity. The Latin writers assert that the Druids also
  worshipped numerous inferior gods.
  They used no images to represent the object of their worship, nor
  did they meet in temples or buildings of any kind for the
  performance of their sacred rites. A circle of stones (each stone
  generally of vast size), enclosing an area of from twenty feet to
  thirty yards in diameter, constituted their sacred place. The most
  celebrated of these now remaining is Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain,
  England.
  These sacred circles were generally situated near some stream, or
  under the shadow of a grove or widespreading oak. In the centre of the
  circle stood the Cromlech or altar, which was a large stone, placed in
  the manner of a table upon other stones set up on end. The Druids
  had also their high places, which were large stones or piles of stones
  on the summits of hills. These were called Cairns, and were used in
  the worship of the deity under the symbol of the sun.
  That the Druids offered sacrifices to their deity there can be no
  doubt. But there is some uncertainty as to what they offered, and of
  the ceremonies connected with their religious services we know
  almost nothing. The classical (Roman) writers affirm that they offered
  on great occasions human sacrifices; as for success in war or for
  relief from dangerous diseases. Caesar has given a detailed account of
  the manner in which this was done. "They have images of immense
  size, the limbs of which are framed with twisted twigs and filled with
  living persons. These being set on fire, those within are
  encompassed by the flames." Many attempts have been made by Celtic
  writers to shake the testimony of the Roman historians to this fact,
  but without success.
  The Druids observed two festivals in each year. The former took
  place in the beginning of May, and was called Beltane or "fire of
  God." On this occasion a large fire was kindled on some elevated spot,
  in honour of the sun, whose returning beneficence they thus welcomed
  after the gloom and desolation of winter. Of this custom a trace
  remains in the name given to Whitsunday in parts of Scotland to this
  day. Sir Walter Scott uses the word in the "Boat Song" in the "Lady of
  the Lake":

  "Ours is no sapling, chance sown by the fountain,
  Blooming at Beltane in winter to fade;" etc.

  The other great festival of the Druids was called "Samh' in," or
  "fire of peace," and was held on Hallow-eve (first of November), which
  still retains this designation in the Highlands of Scotland. On this
  occasion the Druids assembled in solemn conclave, in the most
  central part of the district, to discharge the judicial functions of
  their order. All questions, whether public or private, all crimes
  against person or property, were at this time brought before them
  for adjudication. With these judicial acts were combined certain
  superstitious usages, especially the kindling of the sacred fire, from
  which all the fires in the district, which had been beforehand
  scrupulously extinguished, might be relighted. This usage of
  kindling fires on Hallow-eve lingered in the British islands long
  after the establishment of Christianity.
  Besides these two great annual festivals, the Druids were in the
  habit of observing the full moon, and especially the sixth day of
  the moon. On the latter they sought the Mistletoe, which grew on their
  favourite oaks, and to which, as well as to the oak itself, they
  ascribed a peculiar virtue and sacredness. The discovery of it was
  an occasion of rejoicing and solemn worship. "They call it," says
  Pliny, "by a word in their language, which means 'heal-all,' and
  having made solemn preparation for feasting and sacrifice under the
  tree, they drive thither two milk-white bulls, whose horns are then
  for the first time bound. The priest then, robed in white, ascends the
  tree, and cuts off the mistletoe with a golden sickle. It is caught in
  a white mantle, after which they proceed to slay the victims, at the
  same time praying that God would render his gift prosperous to those
  to whom he had given it." They drink the water in which it has been
  infused, and think it a remedy for all diseases. The mistletoe is a
  parasitic plant, and is not always nor often found on the oak, so that
  when it is found it is the more precious.
  The Druids were the teachers of morality as well as of religion.
  Of their ethical teaching a valuable specimen is preserved in the
  Triads of the Welsh Bards, and from this we may gather that their
  views of moral rectitude were on the whole just, and that they held
  and inculcated many very noble and valuable principles of conduct.
  They were also the men of science and learning of their age and
  people. Whether they were acquainted with letters or not has been
  disputed, though the probability is strong that they were, to some
  extent. But it is certain that they committed nothing of their
  doctrine, their history, or their poetry to writing. Their teaching
  was oral, and their literature (if such a word may be used in such a
  case) was preserved solely by tradition. But the Roman writers admit
  that "they paid much attention to the order and laws of nature, and
  investigated and taught to the youth under their charge many things
  concerning the stars and their motions, the size of the world and
  the lands, and concerning the might and power of the immortal gods."
  Their history consisted in traditional tales, in which the heroic
  deeds of their forefathers were celebrated. These were apparently in
  verse, and thus constituted part of the poetry as well as the
  history of the Druids. In the poems of Ossian we have, if not the
  actual productions of Druidical times, what may be considered faithful
  representations of the songs of the Bards.
  The Bards were an essential part of the Druidical hierarchy. One
  author, Pennant, says, "The Bards were supposed to be endowed with
  powers equal to inspiration. They were the oral historians of all past
  transactions, public and private. They were also accomplished
  genealogists," etc.
  Pennant gives a minute account of the Eisteddfods or sessions of the
  Bards and minstrels, which were held in Wales for many centuries, long
  after the Druidical priesthood in its other departments became
  extinct. At these meetings none but Bards of merit were suffered to
  rehearse their pieces, and minstrels of skill to perform. Judges
  were appointed to decide on their respective abilities, and suitable
  degrees were conferred. In the earlier period the judges were
  appointed by the Welsh princes, and after the conquest of Wales, by
  commission from the kings of England. Yet the tradition is that Edward
  I, in revenge for the influence of the Bards in animating the
  resistance of the people to his sway, persecuted them with great
  cruelty. This tradition has furnished the poet Gray with the subject
  of his celebrated ode, the "Bard."
  There are still occasional meetings of the lovers of Welsh poetry
  and music, held under the ancient name. Among Mrs. Hemans' poems is
  one written for an Eisteddfod, or meeting of Welsh Bards, held in
  London, May 22, 1822. It begins with a description of the ancient
  meeting, of which the following lines are a part:

  "...midst the eternal cliffs, whose strength defied
  The crested Roman in his hour of pride;
  And where the Druid's ancient cromlech frowned,
  And the oaks breathed mysterious murmurs round,
  There thronged the inspired of yore! on plain or height,
  In the sun's face, beneath the eye of light,
  And baring unto heaven each noble head,
  Stood in the circle, where none else might tread."

  The Druidical system was at its height at the time of the Roman
  invasion under Julius Caesar. Against the Druids, as their chief
  enemies, these conquerors of the world directed their unsparing
  fury. The Druids, harassed at all points on the mainland, retreated to
  Anglesey and Iona, where for a season they found shelter and continued
  their now dishonoured rites.
  The Druids retained their predominance in Iona and over the adjacent
  islands and mainland until they were supplanted and their
  superstitions overturned by the arrival of St. Columba, the apostle of
  the Highlands, by whom the inhabitants of that district were first led
  to profess Christianity.
