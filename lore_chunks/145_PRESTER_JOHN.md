PRESTER JOHN
  An early account, communicated probably by travelling merchants,
  of a Lama or spiritual chief among the Tartars, seems to have
  occasioned in Europe the report of a Presbyter or Prester John, a
  Christian pontiff resident in Upper Asia. The Pope sent a mission in
  search of him, as did also Louis IX of France, some years later, but
  both missions were unsuccessful, though the small communities of
  Nestorian Christians, which they did find, served to keep up the
  belief in Europe that such a personage did exist somewhere in the
  East. At last in the fifteenth century, a Portuguese traveller,
  Pedro Covilham, happening to hear that there was a Christian prince in
  the country of the Abessines (Abyssinia), not far from the Red Sea,
  concluded that this must be the true Prester John. He accordingly went
  thither, and penetrated to the court of the king, whom he calls Negus.
  Milton alludes to him in "Paradise Lost," Book XI., where,
  describing Adam's vision of his descendants in their various nations
  and cities, scattered over the face of the earth, he says,-

  "...Nor did his eyes not ken
  Th' empire of Negus, to his utmost port,
  Ercoco, and the less maritime kings,
  Mombaza and Quiloa and Melind."
