RUNIC LETTERS
  One cannot travel far in Denmark, Norway, or Sweden without
  meeting with great stones of different forms, engraven with characters
  called Runic, which appear at first sight very different from all we
  know. The letters consist almost invariably of straight lines, in
  the shape of little sticks either singly or put together. Such
  sticks were in early times used by the northern nations for the
  purpose of ascertaining future events. The sticks were shaken up,
  and from the figures that they formed a kind of divination was
  derived.
  The Runic characters were of various kinds. They were chiefly used
  for magical purposes. The noxious, or, as they called them, the bitter
  runes, were employed to bring various evils on their enemies; the
  favourable averted misfortune. Some were medicinal, others employed to
  win love, etc. In later times they were frequently used for
  inscriptions, of which more than a thousand have been found. The
  language is a dialect of the Gothic, called Norse, still in use in
  Iceland. The inscriptions may therefore be read with certainty, but
  hitherto very few have been found which throw the least light on
  history. They are mostly epitaphs on tombstones.
  Gray's ode on the "Descent of Odin" contains an allusion to the
  use of Runic letters for incantation:

  "Facing to the northern clime,
  Thrice he traced the Runic rhyme;
  Thrice pronounced, in accents dread
  The thrilling verse that wakes the dead,
  Till from out the hollow ground
  Slowly breathed a sullen sound."
