OF LOKI AND HIS PROGENY
  There is another deity who is described as the calumniator of the
  gods and the contriver of all fraud and mischief. His name is Loki. He
  is handsome and well made, but of a very fickle mood and most evil
  disposition. He is of the giant race, but forced himself into the
  company of the gods, and seems to take pleasure in bringing them
  into difficulties, and in extricating them out of the danger by his
  cunning, wit and skill. Loki has three children. The first is the wolf
  Fenris, the second the Midgard serpent, the third Hela (Death). The
  gods were not ignorant that these monsters were growing up, and that
  they would one day bring much evil upon gods and men. So Odin deemed
  it advisable to send one to bring them to him. When they came he threw
  the serpent into that deep ocean by which the earth is surrounded. But
  the monster had grown to such an enormous size that holding his tail
  in his mouth he encircles the whole earth. Hela he cast into
  Niffleheim, and gave her power over nine worlds or regions, into which
  she distributes those who are sent to her; that is, all who die of
  sickness or old age. Her hall is called Elvidner. Hunger is her table,
  Starvation her knife, Delay her man, Slowness her maid, Precipice
  her threshold, Care her bed, and Burning Anguish forms the hangings of
  the apartments. She may easily be recognized, for her body is half
  flesh colour and half blue, and she has a dreadfully stern and
  forbidding countenance.
  The wolf Fenris gave the gods a great deal of trouble before they
  succeeded in chaining him. He broke the strongest fetters as if they
  were made of cobwebs. Finally the gods sent a messenger to the
  mountain spirits, who made for them the chain called Gleipnir. It is
  fashioned of six things, viz., the noise made by the footfall of a
  cat, the beards of women, the roots of stones, the breath of fishes,
  the nerves (sensibilities) of bears, and the spittle of birds. When
  finished it was as smooth and soft as a silken string. But when the
  gods asked the wolf to suffer himself to be bound with this apparently
  slight ribbon, he suspected their design, fearing that it was made
  by enchantment. He therefore only consented to be bound with it upon
  condition that one of the gods put his hand in his (Fenris's) mouth as
  a pledge that the band was to be removed again. Tyr (the god of
  battles) alone had courage enough to do this. But when the wolf
  found that he could not break his fetters, and that the gods would not
  release him, he bit off Tyr's hand, and he has ever since remained
  one-handed.

  HOW THOR PAID THE MOUNTAIN GIANT HIS WAGES.

  Once on a time, when the gods were constructing their abodes and had
  already finished Midgard and Valhalla, a certain artificer came and
  offered to build them a residence so well fortified that they should
  be perfectly safe from the incursions of the Frost giants and the
  giants of the mountains. But he demanded for his reward the goddess
  Freya, together with the sun and moon. The gods yielded to his
  terms, provided he would finish the whole work himself without any
  one's assistance, and all within the space of one winter. But if
  anything remained unfinished on the first day of summer he should
  forfeit the recompense agreed on. On being told these terms the
  artificer stipulated that he should be allowed the use of his horse
  Svadilfari, and this by the advice of Loki was granted to him. He
  accordingly set to work on the first day of winter, and during the
  night let his horse draw stone for the building. The enormous size
  of the stones struck the gods with astonishment, and they saw
  clearly that the horse did one-half more of the toilsome work than his
  master. Their bargain, however, had been concluded, and confirmed by
  solemn oaths, for without these precautions a giant would not have
  thought himself safe among the gods, especially when Thor should
  return from an expedition he had then undertaken against the evil
  demons.
  As the winter drew to a close, the building was far advanced, and
  the bulwarks were sufficiently high and massive to render the place
  impregnable. In short, when it wanted but three days to summer, the
  only part that remained to be finished was the gateway. Then sat the
  gods on their seats of justice and entered into consultation,
  inquiring of one another who among them could have advised to give
  Freya away, or to plunge the heavens in darkness by permitting the
  giant to carry away the sun and the moon.
  They all agreed that no one but Loki, the author of so many evil
  deeds, could have given such bad counsel, and that he should be put to
  a cruel death if he did not contrive some way to prevent the artificer
  from completing his task and obtaining the stipulated recompense. They
  proceeded to lay hands on Loki, who in his fright promised upon oath
  that, let it cost him what it would, he would so manage matters that
  the man should lose his reward. That very night when the man went with
  Svadilfari for building stone, a mare suddenly ran out of a forest and
  began to neigh. The horse thereat broke loose and ran after the mare
  into the forest, which obliged the man also to run after his horse,
  and thus between one and another the whole night was lost, so that
  at dawn the work had not made the usual progress. The man, seeing that
  he must fail of completing his task, resumed his own gigantic stature,
  and the gods now clearly perceived that it was in reality a mountain
  giant who had come amongst them. Feeling no longer bound by their
  oaths, they called on Thor, who immediately ran to their assistance,
  and lifting up his mallet, paid the workman his wages, not with the
  sun and moon, and not even by sending him back to Jotunheim, for
  with the first blow he shattered the giant's skull to pieces and
  hurled him headlong into Niffleheim.
