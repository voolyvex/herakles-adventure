IONA
  One of the smallest of the British Isles, situated near a rugged and
  barren coast, surrounded by dangerous seas, and possessing no
  sources of internal wealth, Iona has obtained an imperishable place in
  history as the seat of civilization and religion at a time when the
  darkness of heathenism hung over almost the whole of Northern
  Europe. Iona or Icolmkill is situated at the extremity of the island
  of Mull, from which it is separated by a strait of half a mile in
  breadth, its distance from the mainland of Scotland being thirty-six
  miles.
  Columba was a native of Ireland, and connected by birth with the
  princes of the land. Ireland was at that time a land of gospel
  light, while the western and northern parts of Scotland were still
  immersed in the darkness of heathenism. Columba with twelve friends
  landed on the island of Iona in the year of our Lord 563, having
  made the passage in a wicker boat covered with hides. The Druids who
  occupied the island endeavoured to prevent his settling there, and the
  savage nations on the adjoining shores incommoded him with their
  hostility, and on several occasions endangered his rife by their
  attacks. Yet by his perseverance and zeal he surmounted all
  opposition, procured from the king a gift of the island, and
  established there a monastery of which he was the abbot. He was
  unwearied in his labours to disseminate a knowledge of the
  Scriptures throughout the Highlands and islands of Scotland, and
  such was the reverence paid him that though not a bishop, but merely a
  presbyter and monk, the entire province with its bishops was subject
  to him and his successors. The Pictish monarch was so impressed with a
  sense of his wisdom and worth that he held him in the highest
  honour, and the neighbouring chiefs and princes sought his counsel and
  availed themselves of his judgment in settling their disputes.
  When Columba landed on Iona he was attended by twelve followers whom
  he had formed into a religious body of which he was the head. To
  these, as occasion required, others were from time to time added, so
  that the original number was always kept up. Their institution was
  called a monastery and the superior an abbot, but the system had
  little in common with the monastic institutions of later times. The
  name by which those who submitted to the rule were known was that of
  Culdees, probably from the Latin "cultores Dei"- worshippers of God.
  They were a body of religious persons associated together for the
  purpose of aiding each other in the common work of preaching the
  gospel and teaching youth, as well as maintaining in themselves the
  fervour of devotion by united exercises of worship. On entering the
  order certain vows were taken by the members, but they were not
  those which were usually imposed by monastic orders, for of these,
  which are three- celibacy, poverty, and obedience,- the Culdees were
  bound to none except the third. To poverty they did not bind
  themselves; on the contrary they seem to have laboured diligently to
  procure for themselves and those dependent on them the comforts of
  life. Marriage also was allowed them, and most of them seem to have
  entered into that state. True, their wives were not permitted to
  reside with them at the institution, but they had a residence assigned
  to them in an adjacent locality, Near Iona there is an island which
  still bears the name of "Eilen nam ban," women's island, where their
  husbands seem to have resided with them, except when duty required
  their presence in the school or the sanctuary.

  Campbell, in his poem of "Reullura," alludes to the married monks of
  Iona:

  "...The pure Culdees
  Were Albyn's earliest priests of God,
  Ere yet an island of her seas
  By foot of Saxon monk was trod,
  Long ere her churchmen by bigotry
  Were barred from holy wedlock's tie.
  'Twas then that Aodh, famed afar,
  In Iona preached the word with power,
  And Reullura, beauty's star,
  Was the partner of his bower."

  In one of his "Irish Melodies," Moore gives the legend of St.
  Senanus and the lady who sought shelter on the island, but was
  repulsed:

  "O, haste and leave this sacred isle,
  Unholy bark, ere morning smile;
  For on thy deck, though dark it be,
  A female form I see;
  And I have sworn this sainted sod
  Shall ne'er by woman's foot be trod."

  In these respects and in others the Culdees departed from the
  established rules of the Romish church, and consequently were deemed
  heretical. The consequence was that as the power of the latter
  advanced that of the Culdees was enfeebled. It was not, however,
  till the thirteenth century that the communities of the Culdees were
  suppressed and the members dispersed. They still continued to labour
  as individuals, and resisted the inroads of Papal usurpation as they
  best might till the light of the Reformation dawned on the world.
  Iona, from its position in the western seas, was exposed to the
  assaults of the Norwegian and Danish rovers by whom those seas were
  infested, and by them it was repeatedly pillaged, its dwellings
  burned, and its peaceful inhabitants put to the sword. These
  unfavourable circumstances led to its gradual decline, which was
  expedited by the subversion of the Culdees throughout Scotland.
  Under the reign of Popery the island became the seat of a nunnery, the
  ruins of which are still seen. At the Reformation, the nuns were
  allowed to remain, living in community, when the abbey was dismantled.
  Iona is now chiefly resorted to by travellers on account of the
  numerous ecclesiastical and sepulchral remains which are found upon
  it. The principal of these are the Cathedral or Abbey Church and the
  Chapel of the Nunnery. Besides these remains of ecclesiastical
  antiquity, there are some of an earlier date, and pointing to the
  existence on the island of forms of worship and belief different
  from those of Christianity. These are the circular Cairns which are
  found in various parts, and which seem to have been of Druidical
  origin. It is in reference to all these remains of ancient religion
  that Johnson exclaims, "That man is little to be envied whose
  patriotism would not gain force upon the plains of Marathon, or
  whose piety would not grow warmer amid the ruins of Iona."
  In the "Lord of the Isles," Scott beautifully contrasts the church
  on Iona with the cave of Staffa, opposite:

  "Nature herself, it seemed, would raise
  A minster to her Maker's praise!
  Not for a meaner use ascend
  Her columns, or her arches bend;
  Nor of a theme less solemn tells
  That mighty surge that ebbs and swells,
  And still between each awful pause,
  From the high vault an answer draws,
  In varied tone, prolonged and high,
  That mocks the organ's melody;
  Nor doth its entrance front in vain
  To old Iona's holy fane,
  That Nature's voice might seem to say,
  Well hast thou done, frail child of clay!
  Thy humble powers that stately shrine
  Tasked high and hard- but witness mine!"
