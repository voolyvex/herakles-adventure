THE CAMENAE
  By this name the Latins designated the Muses, but included under
  it also some other deities, principally nymphs of fountains. Egeria
  was one of them, whose fountain and grotto are still shown. It was
  said that Numa, the second king of Rome, was favoured by this nymph
  with secret interviews, in which she taught him those lessons of
  wisdom and of law which he embodied in the institutions of his
  rising nation. After the death of Numa the nymph pined away and was
  changed into a fountain.

  Byron, in "Childe Harold," Canto IV., thus alludes to Egeria and her
  grotto:

  "Here didst thou dwell, in this enchanted cover,
  Egeria! all thy heavenly bosom beating
  For the far footsteps of thy mortal lover;
  The purple midnight veiled that mystic meeting
  With her most starry canopy;" etc.

  Tennyson, also, in his "Palace of Art," gives us a glimpse of the
  royal lover expecting the interview:

  "Holding one hand against his ear,
  To list a footfall ere he saw
  The wood-nymph, stayed the Tuscan king to hear
  Of wisdom and of law."
