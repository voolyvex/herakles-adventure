MYTH OF OSIRIS AND ISIS
  Osiris and Isis were at one time induced to descend to the earth
  to bestow gifts and blessings on its inhabitants. Isis showed them
  first the use of wheat and barley, and Osiris made the instruments
  of agriculture and taught men the use of them, as well as how to
  harness the ox to the plough. He then gave men laws, the institution
  of marriage, a civil organization, and taught them how to worship
  the gods. After he had thus made the valley of the Nile a happy
  country, he assembled a host with which he went to bestow his
  blessings upon the rest of the world. He conquered the nations
  everywhere, but not with weapons, only with music and eloquence. His
  brother, Typhon saw this, and filled with envy and malice sought
  during his absence to usurp his throne. But Isis, who held the reins
  of government, frustrated his plans. Still more embittered, he now
  resolved to kill his brother. This he did in the following manner:
  Having organized a conspiracy of seventy-two members, he went with
  them to the feast which was celebrated in honour of the king's return.
  He then caused a box or chest to be brought in, which had been made to
  fit exactly the size of Osiris, and declared that he would give that
  chest of precious wood to whomsoever could get into it. The rest tried
  in vain, but no sooner was Osiris in it than Typhon and his companions
  closed the lid and flung the chest into the Nile. When Isis heard of
  the cruel murder she wept and mourned, and then with her hair shorn,
  clothed in black and beating her breast, she sought diligently for the
  body of her husband. In this search she was materially assisted by
  Anubis, the son of Osiris and Nephthys. They sought in vain for some
  time; for when the chest, carried by the waves to the shores of
  Byblos, had become entangled in the reeds that grew at the edge of the
  water, the divine power that dwelt in the body of Osiris imparted such
  strength to the shrub that it grew into a mighty tree, enclosing in
  its trunk the coffin of the god. This tree with its sacred deposit was
  shortly after felled, and erected as a column in the palace of the
  king of Phoenicia. But at length by the aid of Anubis and the sacred
  birds, Isis ascertained these facts, and then went to the royal
  city. There she offered herself at the palace as a servant, and
  being admitted, threw off her disguise and appeared as the goddess,
  surrounded with thunder and lightning. Striking the column with her
  wand she caused it to split open and give up the sacred coffin. This
  she seized and returned with it, and concealed it in the depth of a
  forest, but Typhon discovered it, and cutting the body into fourteen
  pieces scattered them hither and thither. After a tedious search, Isis
  found thirteen pieces, the fishes of the Nile having eaten the
  other. This she replaced by an imitation of sycamore wood, and
  buried the body at Philoe, which became ever after the great burying
  place of the nation, and the spot to which pilgrimages were made
  from all parts of the country. A temple of surpassing magnificence was
  also erected there in honour of the god, and at every place where
  one of his limbs had been found minor temples and tombs were built
  to commemorate the event. Osiris became after that the tutelar deity
  of the Egyptians. His soul was supposed always to inhabit the body
  of the bull Apis, and at his death to transfer itself to his
  successor.
  Apis, the Bull of Memphis, was worshipped with the greatest
  reverence by the Egyptians. The individual animal who was held to be
  Apis was recognized by certain signs. It was requisite that he
  should be quite black, have a white square mark on the forehead,
  another, in the form of an eagle, on his back, and under his tongue
  a lump somewhat in the shape of a scarabaeus or beetle. As soon as a
  bull thus marked was found by those sent in search of him, he was
  placed in a building facing the east, and was fed with milk for four
  months. At the expiration of this term the priests repaired at new
  moon, with great pomp, to his habitation and saluted him Apis. He
  was placed in a vessel magnificently decorated and conveyed down the
  Nile to Memphis, where a temple, with two chapels and a court for
  exercise, was assigned to him. Sacrifices were made to him, and once
  every year, about the time when the Nile began to rise, a golden cup
  was thrown into the river, and a grand festival was held to
  celebrate his birthday. The people believed that during this
  festival the crocodiles forgot their natural ferocity and became
  harmless. There was, however, one drawback to his happy lot: he was
  not permitted to live beyond a certain period, and if, when he had
  attained the age of twenty-five years, he still survived, the
  priests drowned him in the sacred cistern and then buried him in the
  temple of Serapis. On the death of this bull, whether it occurred in
  the course of nature or by violence, the whole land was filled with
  sorrow and lamentations, which lasted until his successor was found.
  We find the following item in one of the newspapers of the day:
  "The Tomb of Apis.- The excavations going on at Memphis bid fair
  to make that buried city as interesting as Pompeii. The monster tomb
  of Apis is now open, after having lain unknown for centuries."

  Milton, in his "Hymn on the Nativity," alludes to the Egyptian
  deities, not as imaginary beings, but as real demons, put to flight by
  the coming of Christ.

  "The brutish gods of Nile as fast,
  Isis and Horus and the dog Anubis haste.
  Nor is Osiris seen
  In Memphian grove or green
  Trampling the unshowered* grass with lowings loud;
  Nor can he be at rest
  Within his sacred chest;
  Nought but profoundest hell can be his shroud.
  In vain with timbrel'd anthems dark
  The sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipped ark."

  * There being no rain in Egypt, the grass is "unshowered," and the
  country depends for its fertility upon the overflowings of the Nile.
  The ark alluded to in the last line is shown by pictures still
  remaining on the walk of the Egyptian temple to have been borne by the
  priests in their religious processions. It probable represented the
  chest in which Osiris was placed.

  Isis was represented in statuary with the head veiled, a symbol of
  mystery. It is this which Tennyson alludes to in "Maud," IV. 8:

  "For the drift of the Maker is dark, an Isis hid by the veil," etc.
