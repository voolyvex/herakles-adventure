VERTUMNUS AND POMONA
  THE Hamadryads were Wood-nymphs. Pomona was of this class. and no
  one excelled her in love of the garden and the culture of fruit. She
  cared not for forests and rivers, but loved the cultivated country,
  and trees that bear delicious apples. Her right hand bore for its
  weapon not a javelin, but a pruning-knife. Armed with this, she busied
  herself at one time to repress the too luxuriant growths: and
  curtail the branches that straggled out of place; at another, to split
  the twig and insert therein a graft, making the branch adopt a
  nursling not its own. She took care, too, that her favourites should
  not suffer from drought, and led streams of water by them, that the
  thirsty roots might drink. This occupation was her pursuit, her
  passion; and she was free from that which Venus inspires. She was
  not without fear of the country people, and kept her orchard locked,
  and allowed not men to enter. The Fauns and Satyrs would have given
  all they possessed to win her, and so would old Sylvanus, who looks
  young for his years, and Pan, who wears a garland of pine leaves
  around his head. But Vertumnus loved her best of all; yet he sped no
  better than the rest. O how often, in the disguise of a reaper, did he
  bring her corn in a basket, and looked the very image of a reaper!
  With a hay band tied round him, one would think he had just come
  from turning over the grass. Sometimes he would have an ox-goad in his
  hand, and you would have said he had just unyoked his weary oxen.
  Now he bore a pruning-hook, and personated a vine-dresser; and
  again, with a ladder on his shoulder, he seemed as if he was going
  to gather apples. Sometimes he trudged along as a discharged
  soldier, and again he bore a fishing-rod, as if going to fish. In this
  way he gained admission to her again and again, and fed his passion
  with the sight of her.
  One day he came in the guise of an old woman, her grey hair
  surmounted with a cap, and a staff in her hand. She entered the garden
  and admired the fruit. "It does you credit, my dear," she said, and
  kissed her not exactly with an old woman's kiss. She sat down on a
  bank, and looked up at the branches laden with fruit which hung over
  her. Opposite was an elm entwined with a vine loaded with swelling
  grapes. She praised the tree and its associated vine, equally.
  "But," said she, "if the tree stood alone, and had no vine clinging to
  it, it would have nothing to attract or offer us but its useless
  leaves. And equally the vine, if it were not twined round the elm,
  would lie prostrate on the ground. Why will you not take a lesson from
  the tree and the vine, and consent to unite yourself with some one?
  I wish you would. Helen herself had not more numerous suitors, nor
  Penelope, the wife of shrewd Ulysses. Even while you spurn them,
  they court you,- rural deities and others of every kind that
  frequent these mountains. But if you are prudent and want to make a
  good alliance, and will let an old woman advise you,- who loves you
  better than you have any idea of,- dismiss all the rest and accept
  Vertumnus, on my recommendation. I know him as well as he knows
  himself. He is not a wandering deity, but belongs to these
  mountains. Nor is he like too many of the lovers nowadays, who love
  any one they happen to see; he loves you, and you only. Add to this,
  he is young and handsome, and has the art of assuming any shape he
  pleases, and can make himself just what you command him. Moreover,
  he loves the same things that you do, delights in gardening, and
  handles your apples with admiration. But now he cares nothing for
  fruits nor flowers, nor anything else, but only yourself. Take pity on
  him, and fancy him speaking now with my mouth. Remember that the
  gods punish cruelty, and that Venus hates a hard heart, and will visit
  such offences sooner or later. To prove this, let me tell you a story,
  which is well known in Cyprus to be a fact; and I hope it will have
  the effect to make you more merciful.
  "Iphis was a young man of humble parentage, who saw and loved
  Anaxarete, a noble lady of the ancient family of Teucer. He
  struggled long with his passion, but when he found he could not subdue
  it, he came a suppliant to her mansion. First he told his passion to
  her nurse, and begged her as she loved her foster-child to favour
  his suit. And then he tried to win her domestics to his side.
  Sometimes he committed his vows to written tablets, and often hung
  at her door garlands which he had moistened with his tears. He
  stretched himself on her threshold, and uttered his complaints to
  the cruel bolts and bars. She was deafer than the surges which rise in
  the November gale; harder than steel from the German forges, or a rock
  that still clings to its native cliff. She mocked and laughed at
  him, adding cruel words to her ungentle treatment, and gave not the
  slightest gleam of hope.
  "Iphis could not any longer endure the torments of hopeless love,
  and, standing before her doors, he spake these last words: 'Anaxarete,
  you have conquered, and shall no longer have to bear my importunities.
  Enjoy your triumph! Sing songs of joy, and bind your forehead with
  laurel,- you have conquered! I die; stony heart, rejoice! This at
  least I can do to gratify you, and force you to praise me; and thus
  shall I prove that the love of you left me but with life. Nor will I
  leave it to rumour to tell you of my death. I will come myself, and
  you shall see me die, and feast your eyes on the spectacle. Yet, O
  ye Gods, who look down on mortal woes, observe my fate! I ask but
  this: let me be remembered in coming ages, and add those years to my
  fame which you have reft from my life.' Thus he said, and, turning his
  pale face and weeping eyes towards her mansion, he fastened a rope
  to the gate-post, on which he had often hung garlands, and putting his
  head into the noose, he murmured, 'This garland at least will please
  you, cruel girl!' and falling hung suspended with his neck broken.
  As he fell he struck against the gate, and the sound was as the
  sound of a groan. The servants opened the door and found him dead, and
  with exclamations of pity raised him and carried him home to his
  mother, for his father was not living. She received the dead body of
  her son, and folded the cold form to her bosom, while she poured forth
  the sad words which bereaved mothers utter. The mournful funeral
  passed through the town, and the pale corpse was borne on a bier to
  the place of the funeral pile. By chance the home of Anaxarete was
  on the street where the procession passed, and the lamentations of the
  mourners met the ears of her whom the avenging deity had already
  marked for punishment.
  "'Let us see this sad procession,' said she, and mounted to a
  turret, whence through an open window she looked upon the funeral.
  Scarce had her eyes rested upon the form of Iphis stretched on the
  bier, when they began to stiffen, and the warm blood in her body to
  become cold. Endeavouring to step back, she found she could not move
  her feet; trying to turn away her face, she tried in vain; and by
  degrees all her limbs became stony like her heart. That you may not
  doubt the fact, the statue still remains, and stands in the temple
  of Venus at Salamis, in the exact form of the lady. Now think of these
  things, my dear, and lay aside your scorn and your delays, and
  accept a lover. So may neither the vernal frosts blight your young
  fruits, nor furious winds scatter your blossoms!"
  When Vertumnus had spoken thus, be dropped the disguise of an old
  woman, and stood before her in his proper person, as a comely youth.
  It appeared to her like the sun bursting through a cloud. He would
  have renewed his entreaties, but there was no need; his arguments
  and the sight of his true form prevailed, and the Nymph no longer
  resisted, but owned a mutual flame.

  Pomona was the especial patroness of the Apple-orchard, and as
  such she was invoked by Phillips, the author of a poem on Cider, in
  blank verse. Thomson in the "Seasons" alludes to him:

  "Phillips, Pomona's bard, the second thou
  Who nobly durst, in rhyme-unfettered verse,
  With British freedom, sing the British song."

  But Pomona was also regarded as presiding over other fruits, and
  as such is invoked by Thomson:

  "Bear me, Pomona, to thy citron groves,
  To where the lemon and the piercing lime,
  With the deep orange, glowing through the green,
  Their lighter glories blend. Lay me reclined
  Beneath the spreading tamarind, that shakes,
  Fanned by the breeze, its fever-cooling fruit."
