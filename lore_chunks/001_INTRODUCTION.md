INTRODUCTION
  THE religions of ancient Greece and Rome are extinct. The
  so-called divinities of Olympus have not a single worshipper among
  living men. They belong now not to the department of theology, but
  to those of literature and taste. There they still hold their place,
  and will continue to hold it, for they are too closely connected
  with the finest productions of poetry and art, both ancient and
  modern, to pass into oblivion.
  We propose to tell the stories relating to them which have come down
  to us from the ancients, and which are alluded to by modern poets,
  essayists, and orators. Our readers may thus at the same time be
  entertained by the most charming fictions which fancy has ever
  created, and put in possession of information indispensable to every
  one who would read with intelligence the elegant literature of his own
  day.
  In order to understand these stories, it will be necessary to
  acquaint ourselves with the ideas of the structure of the universe
  which prevailed among the Greeks- the people from whom the Romans, and
  other nations through them, received their science and religion.
  The Greeks believed the earth to be flat and circular, their own
  country occupying the middle of it, the central point being either
  Mount Olympus, the abode of the gods, or Delphi, so famous for its
  oracle.
  The circular disk of the earth was crossed from west to east and
  divided into two equal parts by the Sea, as they called the
  Mediterranean, and its continuation the Euxine, the only seas with
  which they were acquainted.
  Around the earth flowed the River Ocean, its course being from south
  to north on the western side of the earth, and in a contrary direction
  on the eastern side. It flowed in a steady, equable current, unvexed
  by storm or tempest. The sea, and all the rivers on earth, received
  their waters from it.
  The northern portion of the earth was supposed to be inhabited by
  a happy race named the Hyperboreans, dwelling in everlasting bliss and
  spring beyond the lofty mountains whose caverns were supposed to
  send forth the piercing blasts of the north wind, which chilled the
  people of Hellas (Greece). Their country was inaccessible by land or
  sea. They lived exempt from disease or old age, from toils and
  warfare. Moore has given us the "Song of a Hyperborean," beginning

  "I come from a land in the sun-bright deep,
  Where golden gardens glow,
  Where the winds of the north, becalmed in sleep,
  Their conch shells never blow."

  On the south side of the earth, close to the stream of Ocean,
  dwelt a people happy and virtuous as the Hyperboreans. They were named
  the AEthiopians. The gods favoured them so highly that they were
  wont to leave at times their Olympian abodes and go to share their
  sacrifices and banquets.
  On the western margin of the earth, by the stream of Ocean, lay a
  happy place named the Elysian Plain, whither mortals favoured by the
  gods were transported without tasting of death, to enjoy an
  immortality of bliss. This happy region was also called the "Fortunate
  Fields," and the "Isles of the Blessed."
  We thus see that the Greeks of the early ages knew little of any
  real people except those to the east and south of their own country,
  or near the coast of the Mediterranean. Their imagination meantime
  peopled the western portion of this sea with giants, monsters, and
  enchantresses, while they placed around the disk of the earth, which
  they probably regarded as of no great width, nations enjoying the
  peculiar favour of the gods, and blessed with happiness and longevity.
  The Dawn, the Sun, and the Moon were supposed to rise out of the
  Ocean, on the eastern side, and to drive through the air, giving light
  to gods and men. The stars, also, except those forming the Wain or
  Bear, and others near them, rose the stream of Ocean. There the
  sun-god embarked in a winged boat, which conveyed him round by the
  northern part of the earth, back to his place of rising in the east.
  Milton alludes to this in his "Comus":

  "Now the gilded car of day
  His golden axle doth allay
  In the steep Atlantic stream,
  And the slope Sun his upward beam
  Shoots against the dusky pole,
  Facing towards the other goal
  Of his chamber in the east."

  The abode of the gods was on the summit of Mount Olympus, in
  Thessaly. A gate of clouds, kept by the godesses named the Seasons,
  opened to permit the passage of the Celestials to earth, and to
  receive them on their return. The gods had their separate dwellings;
  but all, when summoned, repaired to the palace of Jupiter, as did also
  those deities whose usual abode was the earth, the waters, or the
  under-world. It was also in the great hall of the palace of the
  Olympian king that the gods feasted each day on ambrosia and nectar,
  their food and drink, the latter being handed round by the lovely
  goddess Hebe. Here they conversed of the affairs of heaven and
  earth; and as they quaffed their nectar, Apollo, the god of music,
  delighted them with the tones of his lyre, to which the Muses sang
  in responsive strains. When the sun was set, the gods retired to sleep
  in their respective dwellings.
  The following lines from the "Odyssey" will show how Homer conceived
  of Olympus:

  "So saying, Minerva, goddess azure-eyed,
  Rose to Olympus, the reputed seat
  Eternal of the gods, which never storms
  Disturb, rains drench, or snow invades, but calm
  The expanse and cloudless shines with purest day.
  There the inhabitants divine rejoice
  For ever." Cowper.

  The robes and other parts of the dress of the goddesses were woven
  by Minerva and the Graces, and everything of a more solid nature was
  formed of the various metals. Vulcan was architect, smith, armourer,
  chariot builder, and artist of all work in Olympus. He built of
  brass the houses of the gods; he made for them the golden shoes with
  which they trod the air or the water, and moved from place to place
  with the speed of the wind, or even of thought. He also shod with
  brass the celestial steeds, which whirled the chariots of the gods
  through the air, or along the surface of the sea. He was able to
  bestow on his workmanship self-motion, so that the tripods (chairs and
  tables) could move of themselves in and out of the celestial hall.
  He even endowed with intelligence the golden handmaidens whom he
  made to wait on himself.
  Jupiter, or Jove (Zeus*), though called the father of gods and
  men, had himself a beginning. Saturn (Cronos) was his father, and Rhea
  (Ops) his mother. Saturn and Rhea were of the race of Titans, who were
  the children of Earth and Heaven, which sprang from Chaos, of which we
  shall give a further account in our next chapter.

  * The names in parentheses are the Greek, the others being the Roman
  or Latin names.

  There is another cosmogony, or account of the creation, according to
  which Earth, Erebus, and Love were the first of beings. Love (Eros)
  issued from the egg of Night, which floated on Chaos. By his arrows
  and torch he pierced and vivified all things, producing life and joy.
  Saturn and Rhea were not the only Titans. There were others, whose
  names were Oceanus, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Ophion, males; and
  Themis, Mnemosyne, Eurynome, females. They are spoken of as the
  elder gods, whose dominion was afterwards transferred to others.
  Saturn yielded to Jupiter, Oceanus to Neptune, Hyperion to Apollo.
  Hyperion was the father of the Sun, Moon, and Dawn. He is therefore
  the original sun-god, and is painted with the splendour and beauty
  which were afterwards bestowed on Apollo.

  "Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself."
  Shakespeare.

  Ophion and Eurynome ruled over Olympus till they were dethroned by
  Saturn and Rhea. Milton alludes to them in "Paradise Lost." He says
  the heathens seem to have had some knowledge of the temptation and
  fall of man.

  "And fabled how the serpent, whom they called
  Ophion, with Eurynome, (the wide-
  Encroaching Eve perhaps,) had first the rule
  Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driven."

  The representations given of Saturn are not very consistent; for
  on the one hand his reign is said to have been the golden age of
  innocence and purity, and on the other he is described as a monster
  who devoured his children.* Jupiter, however, escaped this fate, and
  when grown up espoused Metis (Prudence), who administered a draught to
  Saturn which caused him to disgorge his children. Jupiter, with his
  brothers and sisters, now rebelled against their father Saturn and his
  brothers the Titans; vanquished them, and imprisoned some of them in
  Tartarus, inflicting other penalties on others. Atlas was condemned to
  bear up the heavens on his shoulders.

  * This inconsistency arises from considering the Saturn of the
  Romans the same with the Grecian deity Cronos (Time), which, as it
  brings an end to all things which have had a beginning, may be said to
  devour its own offspring.

  On the dethronement of Saturn, Jupiter with his brothers Neptune
  (Poseidon) and Pluto (Dis) divided his dominions. Jupiter's portion
  was the heavens, Neptune's the ocean, and Pluto's the realms of the
  dead. Earth and Olympus were common property. Jupiter was king of gods
  and men. The thunder was his weapon, and he bore a shield called
  AEgis, made for him by Vulcan. The eagle was his favourite bird, and
  bore his thunderbolts.
  Juno (Hera) was the wife of Jupiter, and queen of the gods. Iris,
  the goddess of the rainbow, was her attendant and messenger. The
  peacock was her favourite bird.
  Vulcan (Hephaestos), the celestial artist, was the son of Jupiter
  and Juno. He was born lame, and his mother was so displeased at the
  sight of him that she flung him out of heaven. Other accounts say that
  Jupiter kicked him out for taking part with his mother in a quarrel
  which occurred between them. Vulcan's lameness, according to this
  account, was the consequence of his fall. He was a whole day
  falling, and at last alighted in the Island of Lemnos, which was
  thenceforth sacred to him. Milton alludes to this story in "Paradise
  Lost,"
  Book I.:

  "...From morn
  To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,
  A summer's day; and with the setting sun
  Dropped from the zenith, like a falling star,
  On Lemnos, the AEgean isle."

  Mars (Ares), the god of war, was the son of Jupiter and Juno,
  Phoebus Apollo, the god of archery, prophecy, and music, was the son
  of Jupiter and Latona, and brother of Diana (Artemis). He was god of
  the sun, as Diana, his sister, was the goddess of the moon.
  Venus (Aphrodite), the goddess of love and beauty, was the
  daughter of Jupiter and Dione. Others say that Venus sprang from the
  foam of the sea. The zephyr wafted her along the waves to the Isle
  of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by the Seasons, and then
  led to the assembly of the gods. All were charmed with her beauty, and
  each one demanded her for his wife. Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in
  gratitude for the service he had rendered in forging thunderbolts.
  So the most beautiful of the goddesses became the wife of the most
  ill-favoured of gods. Venus possessed an embroidered girdle called
  Cestus, which had the power of inspiring love. Her favourite birds
  were swans and doves, and the plants sacred to her were the rose and
  the myrtle.
  Cupid (Eros), the god of love, was the son of Venus. He was her
  constant companion; and, armed with bow and arrows, he shot the
  darts of desire into the bosoms of both gods and men. There was a
  deity named Anteros, who was sometimes represented as the avenger of
  slighted love, and sometimes as the symbol of reciprocal affection.
  The following legend is told of him:
  Venus, complaining to Themis that her son Eros continued always a
  child, was told by her that it was because he was solitary, and that
  if he had a brother he would grow apace. Anteros was soon afterwards
  born, and Eros immediately was seen to increase rapidly in size and
  strength.
  Minerva (Pallas, Athene, the goddess of wisdom,) was the offspring
  of Jupiter, without a mother. She sprang forth from his head
  completely armed. Her favourite bird was the owl, and the plant sacred
  to her the olive.
  Byron, in "Childe Harold," alludes to the birth of Minerva thus:

  "Can tyrants but by tyrants conquered be,
  And Freedom find no champion and no child,
  Such as Columbia saw arise, when she
  Sprang forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled?
  Or must such minds be nourished in the wild,
  Deep in the unpruned forest, 'midst the roar
  Of cataracts, where nursing Nature smiled
  On infant Washington? Has earth no more
  Such seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?"

  Mercury (Hermes) was the son of Jupiter and Maia. He presided over
  commerce, wrestling, and other gymnastic exercises, even over
  thieving, and everything, in short, which required skill and
  dexterity. He was the messenger of Jupiter, and wore a winged cap
  and winged shoes. He bore in his hand a rod entwined with two
  serpents, called the caduceus.
  Mercury is said to have invented the lyre. He found, one day, a
  tortoise, of which he took the shell, made holes in the opposite edges
  of it, and drew cords of linen through them, and the instrument was
  complete. The cords were nine, in honour of the nine Muses. Mercury
  gave the lyre to Apollo, and received from him in exchange the
  caduceus.*

  * From this origin of the instrument, the word "shell" is often used
  as synonymous with "lyre," and figuratively for music and poetry. Thus
  Gray, in his ode on the "Progress of Poesy," says:

  "O Sovereign of the willing Soul,
  Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs,
  Enchanting shell! the sullen Cares
  And frantic Passions hear thy soft control."

  Ceres (Demeter) was the daughter of Saturn and Rhea. She had a
  daughter named Proserpine (Persephone), who became the wife of
  Pluto, and queen of the realms of the dead. Ceres presided over
  agriculture.
  Bacchus (Dionysus), the god of wine, was the son of Jupiter and
  Semele. He represents not only the intoxicating power of wine, but its
  social and beneficent influences likewise, so that he is viewed as the
  promoter of civilization, and a lawgiver and lover of peace.
  The Muses were the daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne (Memory). They
  presided over song, and prompted the memory. They were nine in number,
  to each of whom was assigned the presidence over some particular
  department of literature, art, or science. Calliope was the muse of
  epic poetry, Clio of history, Euterpe of lyric poetry, Melpomene of
  tragedy, Terpsichore of choral dance and song, Erato of love poetry,
  Polyhymnia of sacred poetry, Urania of astronomy, Thalia of comedy.
  The Graces were goddesses presiding over the banquet, the dance, and
  all social enjoyments and elegant arts. They were three in number.
  Their names were Euphrosyne, Aglaia, and Thalia.
  Spenser describes the office of the Graces thus:

  "These three on men all gracious gifts bestow
  Which deck the body or adorn the mind,
  To make them lovely or well-favoured show;
  As comely carriage, entertainment kind,
  Sweet semblance, friendly offices that bind,
  And all the complements of courtesy;
  They teach us how to each degree and kind
  We should ourselves demean, to low, to high,
  To friends, to foes; which skill men call Civility."

  The Fates were also three- Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. Their
  office was to spin the thread of human destiny, and they were armed
  with shears, with which they cut it off when they pleased. They were
  the daughters of Themis (Law), who sits by Jove on his throne to
  give him counsel.
  The Erinnyes, or Furies, were three goddesses who punished by
  their secret stings the crimes of those who escaped or defied public
  justice. The heads of the Furies were wreathed with serpents, and
  their whole appearance was terrific and appalling. Their names were
  Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera. They were also called Eumenides.
  Nemesis was also an avenging goddess. She represents the righteous
  anger of the gods, particularly towards the proud and insolent.
  Pan was the god of flocks and shepherds. His favourite residence was
  in Arcadia.
  The Satyrs were deities of the woods and fields. They were conceived
  to be covered with bristly hair, their heads decorated with short,
  sprouting horns, and their feet like goats' feet.
  Momus was the god of laughter, and Plutus the god of wealth.
