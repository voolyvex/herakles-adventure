ARION- IBYCUS- SIMONIDES- SAPPHO
  THE poets whose adventures compose this chapter were real persons
  some of whose works yet remain, and their influence on poets who
  succeeded them is yet more important than their poetical remains.
  The adventures recorded of them in the following stories rest on the
  same authority as other narratives of the "Age of Fable," that is,
  of the poets who have told them. In their present form, the first
  two are translated from the German, Arion from Schlegel, and Ibycus
  from Schiller.
