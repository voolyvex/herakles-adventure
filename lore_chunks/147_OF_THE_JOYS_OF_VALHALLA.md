OF THE JOYS OF VALHALLA
  Valhalla is the great hall of Odin, wherein he feasts with his
  chosen heroes, all those who have fallen bravely in battle, for all
  who die a peaceful death are excluded. The flesh of the boar Schrimnir
  is served up to them, and is abundant for all. For although this
  boar is cooked every morning, be becomes whole again every night.
  For drink the heroes are supplied abundantly with mead from the
  she-goat Heidrum. When the heroes are not feasting they amuse
  themselves with fighting. Every day they ride out into the court or
  field and fight until they cut each other in pieces. This is their
  pastime; but when meal time comes they recover from their wounds and
  return to feast in Valhalla.
