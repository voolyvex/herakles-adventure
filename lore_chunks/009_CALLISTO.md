CALLISTO
  Callisto was another maiden who excited the jealousy of Juno, and
  the goddess changed her into a bear. "I will take away," said she,
  "that beauty with which you have captivated my husband." Down fell
  Callisto on her hands and knees; she tried to stretch out her arms
  in supplication- they were already beginning to be covered with
  black hair. Her hands grew rounded, became armed with crooked claws,
  and served for feet; her mouth, which Jove used to praise for its
  beauty, became a horrid pair of jaws; her voice, which if unchanged
  would have moved the heart to pity, became a growl, more fit to
  inspire terror. Yet her former disposition remained, and with
  continual groaning, she bemoaned her fate, and stood upright as well
  as she could, lifting up her paws to be, for mercy, and felt that Jove
  was unkind, though she could not tell him so. Ah, how often, afraid to
  stay in the woods all night alone, she wandered about the
  neighbourhood of her former haunts; how often, frightened by the dogs,
  did she, so lately a huntress, fly in terror from the hunters! Often
  she fled from the wild beasts, forgetting that she was now a wild
  beast herself; and, bear as she was, was afraid of the bears.
  One day a youth espied her as he was hunting. She saw him and
  recognized him as her own son, now grown a young man. She stopped
  and felt inclined to embrace him. As she was about to approach, he,
  alarmed, raised his hunting spear, and was on the point of transfixing
  her, when Jupiter, beholding, arrested the crime, and snatching,
  away both of them, placed them in the heavens as the Great and
  Little Bear.
  Juno was in a rage to see her rival so set in honour, and hastened
  to ancient Tethys and Oceanus, the powers of ocean, and in answer to
  their inquiries thus told the cause of her coming: "Do you ask why
  I, the queen of the gods, have left the heavenly plains and sought
  your depths? Learn that I am supplanted in heaven- my place is given
  to another. You will hardly believe me; but look when night darkens
  the world, and you shall see the two of whom I have so much reason
  to complain exalted to the heavens, in that part where the circle is
  the smallest, in the neighborbood of the pole. Why should any one
  hereafter tremble at the thought of offending Juno when such rewards
  are the consequence of my displeasure? See what I have been able to
  effect! I forbade her to wear the human form- she is placed among
  the stars! So do my punishments result- such is the extent of my
  power! Better that she should have resumed her former shape, as I
  permitted Io to do. Perhaps he means to marry her, and put me away!
  But you, my foster-parents, if you feel for me, and see with
  displeasure this unworthy treatment of me, show it, I beseech you,
  by forbidding this couple from coming into your waters." The powers of
  the ocean assented and consequently the two constellations of the
  Great and Little Bear move round and round in heaven, but never
  sink, as the other stars do, beneath the ocean.

  Milton alludes to the fact that the constellation of the Bear
  never sets, when he says:

  "Let my lamp at midnight hour
  Be seen in some high lonely tower,
  Where I may oft outwatch the Bear," etc.

  And Prometheus, in J. R. Lowell's poem, says:

  "One after one the stars have risen and set,
  Sparkling upon the hoar frost of my chain;
  The Bear that prowled all night about the fold
  Of the North-star, hath shrunk into his den,
  Scared by the blithesome footsteps of the Dawn."

  The last star in the tail of the Little Bear is the Polestar, called
  also the Cynosure. Milton says:

  "Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures
  While the landscape round it measures.

  . . . . . . . .

  Towers and battlements it sees
  Bosomed high in tufted trees,
  Where perhaps some beauty lies
  The Cynosure of neighbouring eyes."

  The reference here is both to the Polestar as the guide of mariners,
  and to the magnetic attraction of the North. He calls it also the
  "Star of Arcady," because Callisto's boy was named Arcas, and they
  lived in Arcadia. In "Comus," the brother, benighted in the woods,
  says:

  "...Some gentle taper!
  Though a rush candle, from the wicker hole
  Of some clay habitation, visit us
  With thy long levelled rule of streaming light,
  And thou shalt be our star of Arcady,
  Or Tyrian Cynosure."
