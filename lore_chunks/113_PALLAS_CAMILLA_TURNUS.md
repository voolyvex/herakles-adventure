PALLAS, CAMILLA, TURNUS
  While these things were doing in one part of the field, in another
  Turnus encountered the youthful Pallas. The contest between
  champions so unequally matched could not be doubtful. Pallas bore
  himself bravely, but fell by the lance of Turnus. The victor almost
  relented when he saw the brave youth lying dead at his feet, and
  spared to use the privilege of a Conqueror in despoiling him of his
  arms. The belt only, adorned with studs and carvings of gold, he
  took and clasped round his own body. The rest he remitted to the
  friends of the slain.
  After the battle there was a cessation of arms for some days to
  allow both armies to bury their dead. In this interval AEneas
  challenged Turnus to decide the contest by single combat, but Turnus
  evaded the challenge. Another battle ensued, in which Camilla, the
  virgin warrior, was chiefly conspicuous. Her deeds of valor
  surpassed those of the bravest warriors, and many Trojans and
  Etruscans fell pierced with her darts or struck down by her
  battle-axe. At last an Etruscan named Aruns, who had watched her long,
  seeking for some advantage, observed her pursuing a flying enemy whose
  splendid armour offered a tempting prize. Intent on the chase she
  observed not her danger, and the javelin of Aruns struck her and
  inflicted a fatal wound. She fell and breathed her last in the arms of
  her attendant maidens. But Diana, who beheld her fate, suffered not
  her slaughter to be unavenged. Aruns, as he stole away, glad but
  frightened, was struck by a secret arrow, launched by one of the
  nymphs of Diana's train, and died ignobly and unknown.
  At length the final conflict took place between AEneas and Turnus.
  Turnus had avoided the contest as long as he could, but at last,
  impelled by the ill success of his arms and by the murmurs of his
  followers, he braced himself to the conflict. It could not be
  doubtful. On the side of AEneas were the expressed decree of
  destiny, the aid of his goddess-mother at every emergency, and
  impenetrable armour fabricated by Vulcan, at her request, for her son.
  Turnus, on the other hand, was deserted by his celestial allies,
  Juno having been expressly forbidden by Jupiter to assist him any
  longer. Turnus threw his lance, but it recoiled harmless from the
  shield of AEneas. The Trojan hero then threw his, which penetrated the
  shield of Turnus, and pierced his thigh. Then Turnus's fortitude
  forsook him and he begged for mercy; and AEneas would have given him
  life, but at the instant his eye fell on the belt of Pallas, which
  Turnus had taken from the slaughtered youth. Instantly his rage
  revived, and exclaiming, "Pallas immolates thee with this blow," he
  thrust him through with his sword.
  Here the poem of the "AEneid" closes, and we are left to infer
  that AEneas, having triumphed over his foes, obtained Lavinia for
  his bride. Tradition adds that he founded his city, and called it
  after her name, Lavinium. His son Iulus founded Alba Longa, which
  was the birthplace of Romulus and Remus and the cradle of Rome itself.

  There is an allusion to Camilla in those well-known lines of Pope,
  in which, illustrating the rule that "the sound should be an echo to
  the sense," he says:

  "When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,
  The line too labours and the words move slow.
  Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain,
  Flies o'er the unbending corn or skims along the main."
