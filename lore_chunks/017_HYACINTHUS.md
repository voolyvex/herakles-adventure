HYACINTHUS
  PYGMALION saw so much to blame in women that he came at last to
  abhor the sex, and resolved to live unmarried. He was a sculptor,
  and had made with wonderful skill a statue of ivory, so beautiful that
  no living woman came anywhere near it. It was indeed the perfect
  semblance of a maiden that seemed to be alive, and only prevented from
  moving by modesty. His art was so perfect that it concealed itself and
  its product looked like the workmanship of nature. Pygmalion admired
  his own work, and at last fell in love with the counterfeit
  creation. Oftentimes he laid his hand upon it as if to assure
  himself whether it were living or not, and could not even then believe
  that it was only ivory. He caressed it, and gave it presents such as
  young girls love,- bright shells and polished stones, little birds and
  flowers of various hues, beads and amber. He put raiment on its limbs,
  and jewels on its fingers, and a necklace about its neck. To the
  ears he hung earrings, and strings of pearls upon the breast. Her
  dress became her, and she looked not less charming than when
  unattired. He laid her on a couch spread with cloths of Tyrian dye,
  and called her his wife, and put her head upon a pillow of the softest
  feathers, as if she could enjoy their softness.
  The festival of Venus was at hand- a festival celebrated with
  great pomp at Cyprus. Victims were offered, the altars smoked, and the
  odour of incense filled the air. When Pygmalion had performed his part
  in the solemnities, he stood before the altar and timidly said, "Ye
  gods, who can do all things, give me, I pray you, for my wife"- he
  dared not say "my ivory virgin," but said instead- "one like my
  ivory virgin." Venus, who was present at the festival, heard him and
  knew the thought he would have uttered; and as an omen of her
  favour, caused the flame on the altar to shoot up thrice in a fiery
  point into the air. When he returned home, he went to see his
  statue, and leaning over the couch, gave a kiss to the mouth. It
  seemed to be warm. He pressed its lips again, he laid his hand upon
  the limbs; the ivory felt soft to his touch and yielded to his fingers
  like the wax of Hymettus. While he stands astonished and glad,
  though doubting, and fears he may be mistaken, again and again with
  a lover's ardour he touches the object of his hopes. It was indeed
  alive! The veins when pressed yielded to the finger and again
  resumed their roundness. Then at last the votary of Venus found
  words to thank the goddess, and pressed his lips upon lips as real
  as his own. The virgin felt the kisses and blushed, and opening her
  timid eyes to the light, fixed them at the same moment on her lover.
  Venus blessed the nuptials she had formed, and from this union
  Paphos was born, from whom the city, sacred to Venus, received its
  name.

  Schiller, in his poem the "Ideals," applies this tale of Pygmalion
  to the love of nature in a youthful heart. The following translation
  is furnished by a friend:

  "As once with prayers in passion flowing,
  Pygmalion embraced the stone,
  Till from the frozen marble glowing,
  The light of feeling o'er him shone,
  So did I clasp with young devotion.
  Bright nature to a poet's heart;
  Till breath and warmth and vital motion
  Seemed through the statue form to dart.

  "And then, in all my ardour sharing,
  The silent form expression found;
  Returned my kiss of youth daring,
  And understood my heart's quick sound.
  Then lived for me the bright creation,
  The silver rill with song was rife;
  The trees, the roses shared sensation,
  An echo of my boundless life."- S. G. B.
