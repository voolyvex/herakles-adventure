VENUS AND ADONIS
  Venus, playing one day with her boy Cupid, wounded her bosom with
  one of his arrows. She pushed him away, but the wound was deeper
  than she thought. Before it healed she beheld Adonis, and was
  captivated with him. She no longer took any interest in her
  favourite resorts- Paphos, and Cnidos, and Amathos, rich in metals.
  She absented herself even from heaven, for Adonis was dearer to her
  than heaven. Him she followed and bore him company. She who used to
  love to recline in the shade, with no care but to cultivate her
  charms, now rambles through the woods and over the hills, dressed like
  the huntress Diana; and calls her dogs, and chases hares and stags, or
  other game that it is safe to hunt, but keeps clear of the wolves
  and bears, reeking with the slaughter of the herd. She charged Adonis,
  too, to beware of such dangerous animals. "Be brave towards the
  timid," said she; "courage against the courageous is not safe.
  Beware how you expose yourself to danger and put my happiness to risk.
  Attack not the beasts that Nature has armed with weapons. I do not
  value your glory so high as to consent to purchase it by such
  exposure. Your youth, and the beauty that charms Venus, will not touch
  the hearts of lions and bristly boars. Think of their terrible claws
  and prodigious strength! I hate the whole race of them. Do you ask
  me why?" Then she told him the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes, who
  were changed into lions for their ingratitude to her.
  Having given him this warning, she mounted her chariot drawn by
  swans, and drove away through the air. But Adonis was too noble to
  heed such counsels. The dogs had roused a wild boar from his lair, and
  the youth threw his spear and wounded the animal with sidelong stroke.
  The beast drew out the weapon with his jaws, and rushed after
  Adonis, who turned and ran; but the boar overtook him, and buried
  his tusks in his side, and stretched him dying upon the plain.
  Venus, in her swan-drawn chariot, had not yet reached Cyprus, when
  she heard coming up through mid-air the groans of her beloved, and
  turned her white-winged coursers back to earth. As she drew near and
  saw from on high his lifeless body bathed in blood, she alighted
  and, bending over it, beat her breast and tore her hair. Reproaching
  the Fates, she said, "Yet theirs shall be but a partial triumph;
  memorials of my grief shall endure, and the spectacle of your death,
  my Adonis, and of my lamentation shall be annually renewed. Your blood
  shall be changed into a flower; that consolation none can envy me."
  Thus speaking, she sprinkled nectar on the blood; and as they mingled,
  bubbles rose as in a pool on which raindrops fall, and in an hour's
  time there sprang up a flower of bloody hue like that of the
  pomegranate. But it is short-lived. It is said the wind blows the
  blossoms open, and afterwards blows the petals away; so it is called
  Anemone, or Wind Flower, from the cause which assists equally in its
  production and its decay.

  Milton alludes to the story of Venus and Adonis in his "Comus":

  "Beds of hyacinth and roses
  Where young Adonis oft reposes,
  Waxing well of his deep wound
  In slumber soft, and on the ground
  Sadly sits th' Assyrian queen;" etc.
