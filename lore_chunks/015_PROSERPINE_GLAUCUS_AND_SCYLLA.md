PROSERPINE- GLAUCUS AND SCYLLA
  WHEN Jupiter and his brothers had defeated the Titars and banished
  them to Tartarus, a new enemy rose up against the gods. They were
  the giants Typhon, Briareus, Enceladus, and others. Some of them had a
  hundred arms, others breathed out fire. They were finally subdued
  and buried alive under Mount AEtna, where they still sometimes
  struggle to get loose, and shake the whole island with earthquakes.
  Their breath comes up through the mountain, and is what men call the
  eruption of the volcano.
  The fall of these monsters shook the earth, so that Pluto was
  alarmed, and feared that his kingdom would be laid open to the light
  of day. Under this apprehension, he mounted his chariot, drawn by
  black horses, and took a circuit of inspection to satisfy himself of
  the extent of the damage. While he was thus engaged, Venus, who was
  sitting on Mount Eryx playing with her boy Cupid, espied him, and
  said, "My son, take your darts with which you conquer all, even Jove
  himself, and send one into the breast of yonder dark monarch, who
  rules the realm of Tartarus. Why should he alone escape? Seize the
  opportunity to extend your empire and mine. Do you not see that even
  in heaven some despise our power? Minerva the wise, and Diana the
  huntress, defy us; and there is that daughter of Ceres, who
  threatens to follow their example. Now do you, if you have any
  regard for your own interest or mine, join these two in one." The
  boy unbound his quiver, and selected his sharpest and truest arrow;
  then straining the bow against his knee, he attached the string,
  and, having made ready, shot the arrow with its barbed point right
  into the heart of Pluto.
  In the vale of Enna there is a lake embowered in woods, which screen
  it from the fervid rays of the sun, while the moist ground is
  covered with flowers, and Spring reigns perpetual. Here Proserpine was
  playing with her companions, gathering lilies and violets, and filling
  her basket and her apron with them, when Pluto saw her, loved her, and
  carried her off. She screamed for help to her mother and companions;
  and when in her fright she dropped the corners of her apron and let
  the flowers fall, childlike she felt the loss of them as an addition
  to her grief. The ravisher urged on his steeds, calling them each by
  name, and throwing loose over their heads and necks his
  iron-coloured reins. When he reached the River Cyane, and it opposed
  his passage, he struck the river-bank with his trident, and the
  earth opened and gave him a passage to Tartarus.
  Ceres sought her daughter all the world over. Bright-haired
  Aurora, when she came forth in the morning, and Hesperus when he led
  out the stars in the evening, found her still busy in the search.
  But it was all unavailing. At length, weary and sad, she sat down upon
  a stone, and continued sitting nine days and nights, in the open
  air, under the sunlight and moonlight and falling showers. It was
  where now stands the city of Eleusis, then the home of an old man
  named Celeus. He was out on the field, gathering acorns and
  blackberries, and sticks for his fire. His little girl was driving
  home their two goats, and as she passed the goddess, who appeared in
  the guise of an old woman, she said to her, "Mother,"- and the name
  was sweet to the ears of Ceres,- "why do you sit here alone upon the
  rocks?" The old man also stopped, though his load was heavy, and
  begged her to come into his cottage, such as it was. She declined, and
  he urged her. "Go in peace," she replied, "and be happy in your
  daughter; I have lost mine." As she spoke, tears- or something like
  tears, for the gods never weep- fell down her cheeks upon her bosom.
  The compassionate old man and his child wept with her. Then said he,
  "Come with us, and despise not our humble roof; so may your daughter
  be restored to you in safety." "Lead on," said she, "I cannot resist
  that appeal!" So she rose from the stone and went with them. As they
  walked he told her that his only son, a little boy, lay very sick,
  feverish, and sleepless. She stooped and gathered some poppies. As
  they entered the cottage, they found all in great distress, for the
  boy seemed past hope of recovery. Metanira, his mother, received her
  kindly, and the goddess stooped and kissed the lips of the sick child.
  Instantly the paleness left his face, and healthy vigour returned to
  his body. The whole family were delighted- that is, the father,
  mother, and little girl, for they were all; they had no servants. They
  spread the table, and put upon it curds and cream, apples, and honey
  in the comb. While they ate, Ceres mingled poppy juice in the milk
  of the boy. When night came and all was still, she arose, and taking
  the sleeping boy, moulded his limbs with her hands, and uttered over
  him three times a solemn charm, then went and laid him in the ashes.
  His mother, who had been watching what her guest was doing, sprang
  forward with a cry and snatched the child from the fire. Then Ceres
  assumed her own form, and a divine splendour shone all around. While
  they were overcome with astonishment, she said, "Mother, you have been
  cruel in your fondness to your son. I would have made him immortal,
  but you have frustrated my attempt. Nevertheless, he shall be great
  and useful. He shall teach men the use of the plough, and the
  rewards which labour can win from the cultivated soil." So saying, she
  wrapped a cloud about her, and mounting her chariot rode away.
  Ceres continued her search for her daughter, passing from land to
  land, and across seas and rivers, till at length she returned to
  Sicily, whence she at first set out, and stood by the banks of the
  River Cyane, where Pluto made himself a passage with his prize to
  his own dominions. The river nymph would have told the goddess all she
  had witnessed, but dared not, for fear of Pluto; so she only
  ventured to take up the girdle which Proserpine had dropped in her
  flight, and waft it to the feet of the mother. Ceres, seeing this, was
  no longer in doubt of her loss, but she did not yet know the cause,
  and laid the blame on the innocent land. "Ungrateful soil," said
  she, "which I have endowed with fertility and clothed with herbage and
  nourishing grain, no more shall you enjoy my favours." Then the cattle
  died, the plough broke in the furrow, the seed failed to come up;
  there was too much sun, there was too much rain; the birds stole the
  seeds- thistles and brambles were the only growth. Seeing this, the
  fountain Arethusa interceded for the land. "Goddess," said she, "blame
  not the land; it opened unwillingly to yield a passage to your
  daughter. I can tell you of her fate, for I have seen her. This is not
  my native country; I came hither from Elis. I was a woodland nymph,
  and delighted in the chase. They praised my beauty, but I cared
  nothing for it, and rather boasted of my hunting exploits. One day I
  was returning from the wood, heated with exercise, when I came to a
  stream silently flowing, so clear that you might count the pebbles
  on the bottom. The willows shaded it, and the grassy bank sloped
  down to the water's edge. I approached, I touched the water with my
  foot. I stepped in knee-deep, and not content with that, I laid my
  garments on the willows and went in. While I sported in the water, I
  heard an indistinct murmur coming up as out of the depths of the
  stream; and made haste to escape to the nearest bank. The voice
  said, 'Why do you fly, Arethusa? I am Alpheus, the god of this
  stream.' I ran, he pursued; he was not more swift than I, but he was
  stronger, and gained upon me, as my strength failed. At last,
  exhausted, I cried for help to Diana. 'Help me, goddess! help your
  votary!' The goddess heard, and wrapped me suddenly in a thick
  cloud. The river god looked now this way and now that, and twice
  came close to me, but could not find me. 'Arethusa! Arethusa!' he
  cried. Oh, how I trembled,- like a lamb that hears the wolf growling
  outside the fold. A cold sweat came over me, my hair flowed down in
  streams; where my foot stood there was a pool. In short, in less
  time than it takes to tell it, I became a fountain. But in this form
  Alpheus knew me and attempted to mingle his stream with mine. Diana
  cleft the ground, and I, endeavouring to escape him, plunged into
  the cavern, and through the bowels of the earth came out here in
  Sicily. While I passed through the lower parts of the earth, I saw
  your Proserpine. She was sad, but no longer showing alarm in her
  countenance. Her look was such as became a queen- the queen of Erebus;
  the powerful bride of the monarch of the realms of the dead."
  When Ceres heard this, she stood for a while like one stupefied;
  then turned her chariot towards heaven, and hastened to present
  herself before the throne of Jove. She told the story of her
  bereavement, and implored Jupiter to interfere to procure the
  restitution of her daughter. Jupiter consented on one condition,
  namely, that Proserpine should not during her stay in the lower
  world have taken any food; otherwise, the Fates forbade her release.
  Accordingly, Mercury was sent, accompanied by Spring, to demand
  Proserpine of Pluto. The wily monarch consented; but, alas! the maiden
  had taken a pomegranate which Pluto offered her, and had sucked the
  sweet pulp from a few of the seeds. This was enough to prevent her
  complete release; but a compromise was made, by which she was to
  pass half the time with her mother, and the rest with her husband
  Pluto.
  Ceres allowed herself to be pacified with this arrangement, and
  restored the earth to her favour. Now she remembered Celeus and his
  family, and her promise to his infant son Triptolemus. When the boy
  grew up, she taught him the use of the plough, and how to sow the
  seed. She took him in her chariot, drawn by winged dragons, through
  all the countries of the earth, imparting to mankind valuable
  grains, and the knowledge of agriculture. After his return,
  Triptolemus built a magnificent temple to Ceres in Eleusis, and
  established the worship of the goddess, under the name of the
  Eleusinian mysteries, which, in the splendour and solemnity of their
  observance, surpassed all other religious celebrations among the
  Greeks.
  There can be little doubt of this story of Ceres and Proserpine
  being an allegory. Proserpine signifies the seed-corn which when
  cast into the ground lies there concealed- that is, she is carried off
  by the god of the underworld. It reappears- that is, Proserpine is
  restored to her mother. Spring leads her back to the light of day.

  Milton alludes to the story of Proserpine in "Paradise Lost," Book
  IV.:

  "...Not that fair field
  Of Enna where Proserpine gathering flowers,
  Herself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis
  Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain
  To seek her through the world,-
  ...might with this Paradise
  Of Eden strive."

  Hood, in his "Ode to Melancholy," uses the same allusion very
  beautifully:

  "Forgive, if somewhile I forget,
  In woe to come the present bliss;
  As frighted Proserpine let fall
  Her flowers at the sight of Dis."

  The River Alpheus does in fact disappear underground, in part of its
  course, finding its way through subterranean channels till it again
  appears on the surface. It was said that the Sicilian fountain
  Arethusa was the same stream, which, after passing under the sea, came
  up again in Sicily. Hence the story ran that a cup thrown into the
  Alpheus appeared again in Arethusa. It is this fable of the
  underground course of Alpheus that Coleridge alludes to in his poem of
  "Kubla Khan":

  "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
  A stately pleasure-dome decree,
  Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
  Through caverns measureless to man,
  Down to a sunless sea."

  In one of Moore's juvenile poems he thus alludes to the same
  story, and to the practice of throwing garlands or other light objects
  on his stream to be carried downward by it, and afterwards
  reproduced at its emerging:

  "O my beloved, how divinely sweet
  Is the pure joy when kindred spirits meet!
  Like him the river god, whose waters flow,
  With love their only light, through caves below,
  Wafting in triumph all the flowery braids
  And festal rings, with which Olympic maids
  Have decked his current, as an offering meet
  To lay at Arethusa's shining feet.
  Think, when he meets at last his fountain bride,
  What perfect love must thrill the blended tide!
  Each lost in each, till mingling into one,
  Their lot the same for shadow or for sun,
  A type of true love, to the deep they run."

  The following extract from Moore's "Rhymes on the Road" gives an
  account of a celebrated picture by Albano, at Milan, called a Dance of
  Loves:

  "'Tis for the theft of Enna's flower from earth
  These urchins celebrate their dance of mirth,
  Round the green tree, like fays upon a heath;-
  Those that are nearest Linked in order bright,
  Cheek after cheek, like rosebuds in a wreath;
  And those more distant showing from beneath
  The others' wings their little eyes of light.
  While see! among the clouds, their eldest brother,
  But just flown up, tells with a smile of bliss,
  This prank of Pluto to his charmed mother,
  Who turns to greet the tidings with a kiss."
