FATE OF THE SUITORS
  Ulysses had now been away from Ithaca for twenty years, and when
  he awoke he did not recognize his native land. Minerva appeared to him
  in the form of a young shepherd, informed him where he was, and told
  him the state of things at his palace. More than a hundred nobles of
  Ithaca and of the neighbouring islands had been for years suing for
  the hand of Penelope, his wife, imagining him dead, and lording it
  over his palace and people, as if they were owners of both. That he
  might be able to take vengeance upon them, it was important that he
  should not be recognized. Minerva accordingly metamorphosed him into
  an unsightly beggar, and as such he was kindly received by Eumaeus,
  the swine-herd, a faithful servant of his house.
  Telemachus, his son, was absent in quest of his father. He had
  gone to the courts of the other kings, who had returned from the
  Trojan expedition. While on the search, he received counsel from
  Minerva to return home. He arrived and sought Eumaeus to learn
  something of the state of affairs at the palace before presenting
  himself among the suitors. Finding a stranger with Eumaeus, he treated
  him courteously, though in the garb of a beggar, and promised him
  assistance. Eumaeus was sent to the palace to inform Penelope
  privately of her son's arrival, for caution was necessary with
  regard to the suitors, who, as Telemachus had learned, were plotting
  to intercept and kill him. When Eumaeus was gone, Minerva presented
  herself to Ulysses, and directed him to make himself known to his son.
  At the same time she touched him, removed at once from him the
  appearance of age and penury, and gave him the aspect of vigorous
  manhood that belonged to him. Telemachus viewed him with astonishment,
  and at first thought he must be more than mortal. But Ulysses
  announced himself as his father, and accounted for the change of
  appearance by explaining that it was Minerva's doing.

  "...Then threw Telemachus
  His arms around his father's neck and wept.
  Desire intense of lamentation seized.
  On both; soft murmurs uttering, each indulged
  His grief."

  The father and son took counsel together how they should get the
  better of the suitors and punish them for their outrages. It was
  arranged that Telemachus should proceed to the palace and mingle
  with the suitors as formerly; that Ulysses should also go as a beggar,
  a character which in the rude old times had different privileges
  from what we concede to it now. As traveller and storyteller, the
  beggar was admitted in the halls of chieftains, and often treated like
  a guest; though sometimes, also, no doubt, with contumely. Ulysses
  charged his son not to betray, by any display of unusual interest in
  him, that he knew him to be other than he seemed, and even if he saw
  him insulted, or beaten, not to interpose otherwise than he might do
  for any stranger. At the palace they found the usual scene of feasting
  and riot going on. The suitors pretended to receive Telemachus with
  joy at his return, though secretly mortified at the failure of their
  plots to take his life. The old beggar was permitted to enter, and
  provided with a portion from the table. A touching incident occurred
  as Ulysses entered the courtyard of the palace. An old dog lay in
  the yard almost dead with age, and seeing a stranger enter, raised his
  head, with ears erect. It was Argus, Ulysses' own dog, that he had
  in other days often led to the chase.

  "...Soon as he perceived
  Long-lost Ulysses nigh, down fell his ears
  Clapped close, and with his tall glad sign he gave
  Of gratulation, impotent to rise,
  And to approach his master as of old.
  Ulysses, noting him, wiped off a tear
  Unmarked.
  ...Then his destiny released
  Old Argus, soon as he had lived to see
  Ulysses in the twentieth year restored."

  As Ulysses sat eating his portion in the hall, the suitors began
  to exhibit their insolence to him. When he mildly remonstrated, one of
  them raised a stool and with it gave him a blow. Telemachus had hard
  work to restrain his indignation at seeing his father so treated in
  his own hall, but remembering his father's injunctions, said no more
  than what became him as master of the house, though young, and
  protector of his guests.
  Penelope had protracted her decision in favour of either of her
  suitors so long that there seemed to be no further pretence for delay.
  The continued absence of her husband seemed to prove that his return
  was no longer to be expected. Meanwhile her son had grown up, and
  was able to manage his own affairs. She therefore consented to
  submit the question of her choice to a trial of skill among the
  suitors. The test selected was shooting with the bow. Twelve rings
  were arranged in a line, and he whose arrow was sent through the whole
  twelve was to have the queen for his prize. A bow that one of his
  brother heroes had given to Ulysses in former times was brought from
  the armoury, and with its quiver full of arrows was laid in the
  hall. Telemachus had taken care that all other weapons should be
  removed, under pretence that in the heat of competition there was
  danger, in some rash moment, of putting them to an improper use.
  All things being prepared for the trial, the first thing to be
  done was to bend the bow in order to attach the string. Telemachus
  endeavoured to do it, but found all his efforts fruitless; and
  modestly confessing that he had attempted a task beyond his
  strength, he yielded the bow to another. He tried it with no better
  success, and, amidst the laughter and jeers of his companions, gave it
  up. Another tried it and another; they rubbed the bow with tallow, but
  all to no purpose; it would not bend. Then spoke Ulysses, humbly
  suggesting that he should be permitted to try; for, said he, "beggar
  as I am, I was once a soldier, and there is still some strength in
  these old limbs of mine." The suitors hooted with derision, and
  commanded to turn him out of the hall for his insolence. But
  Telemachus spoke up for him, and, merely to gratify the old man,
  bade him try. Ulysses took the bow, and handled it with the hand of
  a master. With ease he adjusted the cord to its notch, then fitting an
  arrow to the bow be drew the string and sped the arrow unerring
  through the rings.
  Without allowing them time to express their astonishment, he said,
  "Now for another mark!" and aimed direct at the most insolent one of
  the suitors. The arrow pierced through his throat and he fell dead.
  Telemachus, Eumaeus, and another faithful follower, well armed, now
  sprang to the side of Ulysses. The suitors, in amazement, looked round
  for arms, but found none, neither was there any way of escape, for
  Eumaeus had secured the door. Ulysses left them not long in
  uncertainty; he announced himself as the long-lost chief, whose
  house they had invaded, whose substance they had squandered, whose
  wife and son they had persecuted for ten long years; and told them
  he meant to have ample vengeance. All were slain, and Ulysses was left
  master of his palace and possessor of his kingdom and his wife.

  Tennyson's poem of "Ulysses" represents the old hero, after his
  dangers past and nothing left but to stay at home and be happy,
  growing tired of inaction and resolving to set forth again in quest of
  new adventures:

  "...Come, my friends,
  'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
  Push off, and sitting well in order smite
  The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
  To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
  Of all the western stars, until I die.
  It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;
  It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
  And see the great Achilles whom we knew;" etc.
