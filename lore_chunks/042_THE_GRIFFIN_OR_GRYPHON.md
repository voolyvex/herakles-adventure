THE GRIFFIN, OR GRYPHON
  The Griffin is a monster with the body of a lion, the head and wings
  of an eagle, and back covered with feathers. Like birds it builds
  its nest, and instead of an egg lays an agate therein. It has long
  claws and talons of such a size that the people of that country make
  them into drinking-cups. India was assigned as the native country of
  the Griffins. They found gold in the mountains and built their nests
  of it, for which reason their nests were very tempting to the hunters,
  and they were forced to keep vigilant guard over them. Their
  instinct led them to know where buried treasures lay, and they did
  their best to keep plunderers at a distance. The Arimaspians, among
  whom the Griffins flourished, were a one-eyed people of Scythia.
  Milton borrows a simile from the Griffins, "Paradise Lose," Book
  II.:

  "As when a Gryphon through the wilderness
  With winged course, o'er hill and moory dale,
  Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth
  Had from his wakeful custody purloined
  The guarded gold," etc.
