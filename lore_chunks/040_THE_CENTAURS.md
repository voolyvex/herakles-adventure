THE CENTAURS
  These monsters were represented as men from the head to the loins,
  while the remainder of the body was that of a horse. The ancients were
  too fond of a horse to consider the union of his nature with man's
  as forming a very degraded compound, and accordingly the Centaur is
  the only one of the fancied monsters of antiquity to which any good
  traits are assigned. The Centaurs were admitted to the companionship
  of man, and at the marriage of Pirithous with Hippodamia they were
  among the guests. At the feast Eurytion, one of the Centaurs, becoming
  intoxicated with the wine, attempted to offer violence to the bride;
  the other Centaurs followed his example, and a dreadful conflict arose
  in which several of them were slain. This is the celebrated battle
  of the Lapithae and Centaurs, a favourite subject with the sculptors
  and poets of antiquity.
  But not all the Centaurs were like the rude guests of Pirithous.
  Chiron was instructed by Apollo and Diana, and was renowned for his
  skill in hunting, medicine, music, and the art of prophecy. The most
  distinguished heroes of Grecian story were his pupils. Among the
  rest the infant AEsculapius was intrusted to his charge by Apollo, his
  father. When the sage returned to his home bearing the infant, his
  daughter Ocyrhoe came forth to meet him, and at sight of the child
  burst forth into a prophetic strain (for she was a prophetess),
  foretelling the glory that he was to achieve. AEsculapius when grown
  up became a renowned physician, and even in one instance succeeded
  in restoring the dead to life. Pluto resented this, and Jupiter, at
  his request, struck the bold physician with lightning, and killed him,
  but after his death received him into the number of the gods.
  Chiron was the wisest and justest of all the Centaurs, and at his
  death Jupiter placed him among the stars as the constellation
  Sagittarius.
