ADMETUS AND ALCESTIS
  AEsculapius, the son of Apollo, was endowed by his father with
  such skill in the healing art that he even restored the dead to
  life. At this Pluto took alarm, and prevailed on Jupiter to launch a
  thunderbolt at AEsculapius. Apollo was indignant at the destruction of
  his son, and wreaked his vengeance on the innocent workmen who had
  made the thunderbolt. These were the Cyclopses, who have their
  workshop under Mount AEtna, from which the smoke and flames of their
  furnaces are constantly issuing. Apollo shot his arrows at the
  Cyclopses, which so incensed Jupiter that he condemned him as a
  punishment to become the servant of a mortal for the space of one
  year. Accordingly Apollo went into the service of Admetus, king of
  Thessaly, and pastured his flocks for him on the verdant banks of
  the river Amphrysos.
  Admetus was a suitor, with others, for the hand of Alcestis, the
  daughter of Pelias, who promised her to him who should come for her in
  a chariot drawn by lions and boars. This task Admetus performed by the
  assistance of his divine herdsman, and was made happy in the
  possession of Alcestis. But Admetus fell ill, and being near to death,
  Apollo prevailed on the Fates to spare him on condition that some
  one would consent to die in his stead. Admetus, in his joy at this
  reprieve, thought little of the ransom, and perhaps remembering the
  declarations of attachment which he had often heard from his courtiers
  and dependents fancied that it would be easy to find a substitute. But
  it was not so. Brave warriors, who would willingly have perilled their
  lives for their prince, shrunk from the thought of dying for him on
  the bed of sickness; and old servants who had experienced his bounty
  and that of his house from their childhood up, were not willing to lay
  down the scanty remnant of their days to show their gratitude. Men
  asked, "Why does not one of his parents do it? They cannot in the
  course of nature live much longer, and who can feel like them the call
  to rescue the life they gave from an untimely end?" But the parents,
  distressed though they were at the thought of losing him, shrunk
  from the call. Then Alcestis, with a generous self-devotion, proffered
  herself as the substitute. Admetus, fond as he was of life, would
  not have submitted to receive it at such a cost; Lut there was no
  remedy. The condition imposed by the Fates had been met, and the
  decree was irrevocable. Alcestis sickened as Admetus revived, and
  she was rapidly sinking to the grave.
  Just at this time Hercules arrived at the Palace of Admetus, and
  found all the inmates in great distress for the impending loss of
  the devoted wife and beloved mistress. Hercules, to whom no labour was
  too arduous, resolved to attempt her rescue. He went and lay in wait
  at the door of the chamber of the dying queen, and when Death came for
  his prey, he seized him and forced him to resign his victim.
  Alcestis recovered, and was restored to her husband.

  Milton alludes to the story of Alcestis in his Sonnet "on his
  deceased wife":

  "Methought I saw my late espoused saint
  Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,
  Whom Jove's great son to her glad husband gave,
  Rescued from death by force, though pale and faint."

  J. R. Lowell has chosen the "Shepherd of King Admetus" for the
  subject of a short poem. He makes that event the first introduction of
  poetry to men.

  "Men called him but a shiftless youth,
  In whom no good they saw,
  And yet unwittingly, in truth,
  They made his careless words their law.

  "And day by day more holy grew
  Each spot where he had trod,
  Till after-poets only knew
  Their first-born brother was a god."
