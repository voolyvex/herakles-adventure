ANTIGONE
  A large proportion both of the interesting persons and of the
  exalted acts of legendary Greece belongs to the female sex. Antigone
  was as bright an example of filial and sisterly fidelity as was
  Alcestis of connubial devotion. She was the daughter of OEdipus and
  Jocasta, who with all their descendants were the victims of an
  unrelenting fate, dooming them to destruction. OEdipus in his
  madness had torn out his eyes, and was driven forth from his kingdom
  Thebes, dreaded and abandoned by all men, as an object of divine
  vengeance. Antigone, his daughter, alone shared his wanderings and
  remained with him till he died, and then returned to Thebes.
  Her brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, had agreed to share the
  kingdom between them, and reign alternately year by year. The first
  year fell to the lot of Eteocles, who, when his time expired,
  refused to surrender the kingdom to his brother. Polynices fled to
  Adrastus, king of Argos, who gave him his daughter in marriage, and
  aided him with an army to enforce his claim to the kingdom. This led
  to the celebrated expedition of the "Seven against Thebes," which
  furnished ample materials for the epic and tragic poets of Greece.
  Amphiaraus, the brother-in-law of Adrastus, opposed the
  enterprise, for he was a soothsayer, and knew by his art that no one
  of the leaders except Adrastus would live to return. But Amphiaraus,
  on his marriage to Eriphyle, the king's sister, had agreed that
  whenever he and Adrastus should differ in opinion, the decision should
  be left to Eriphyle. Polynices, knowing this, gave Eriphyle the collar
  of Harmonia, and thereby gained her to his interest. This collar or
  necklace was a present which Vulcan had given to Harmonia on her
  marriage with Cadmus, and Polynices had taken it with him on his
  flight from Thebes. Eriphyle could not resist so tempting a bribe, and
  by her decision the war was resolved on, and Amphiaraus went to his
  certain fate. He bore his part bravely in the contest, but could not
  avert his destiny. Pursued by the enemy, he fled along the river, when
  a thunderbolt launched by Jupiter opened the ground, and he, his
  chariot, and his charioteer were swallowed up.
  It would not be in place here to detail all the acts of heroism or
  atrocity which marked the contest; but we must not omit to record
  the fidelity of Evadne as an offset to the weakness of Eriphyle.
  Capaneus, the husband of Evadne, in the ardour of the fight declared
  that he would force his way into the city in spite of Jove himself.
  Placing a ladder against the wall he mounted, but Jupiter, offended at
  his impious language, struck him with a thunderbolt. When his
  obsequies were celebrated, Evadne cast herself on his funeral pile and
  perished.
  Early in the contest Eteocles consulted the soothsayer Tiresias as
  to the issue. Tiresias in his youth had by chance seen Minerva
  bathing. The goddess in her wrath deprived him of his sight, but
  afterwards relenting gave him in compensation the knowledge of
  future events. When consulted by Eteocles, he declared that victory
  should fall to Thebes if Menoeceus, the son of Creon, gave himself a
  voluntary victim. The heroic youth, learning the response, threw
  away his life in the first encounter.
  The siege continued long, with various success. At length both hosts
  agreed that the brothers should decide their quarrel by single combat.
  They fought and fell by each other's hands. The armies then renewed
  the fight, and at last the invaders were forced to yield, and fled,
  leaving their dead unburied. Creon, the uncle of the fallen princes,
  now become king, caused Eteocles to be buried with distinguished
  honour, but suffered the body of Polynices to lie where it fell,
  forbidding every one on pain of death to give it burial.
  Antigone, the sister of Polynices, heard with indignation the
  revolting edict which consigned her brother's body to the dogs and
  vultures, depriving it of those rites which were considered
  essential to the repose of the dead. Unmoved by the dissuading counsel
  of an affectionate but timid sister, and unable to procure assistance,
  she determined to brave the hazard, and to bury the body with her
  own hands. She was detected in the act, and Creon gave orders that she
  should be buried alive, as having deliberately set at naught the
  solemn edict of the city. Her lover, Haemon, the son of Creon,
  unable to avert her fate, would not survive her, and fall by his own
  hand.

  Antigone forms the subject of two fine tragedies of the Grecian poet
  Sophocles. Mrs. Jameson, in her "Characteristics of Women," has
  compared her character with that of Cordelia, in Shakspeare's "King
  Lear."
  The following is the lamentation of Antigone over OEdipus, when
  death has at last relieved him from his sufferings:

  "Alas! I only wished I might have died
  With my poor father; wherefore should I ask
  For longer life?
  O, I was fond of misery with him;
  E'en what was most unlovely grew beloved
  When he was with me. O my dearest father,
  Beneath the earth now in deep darkness hid,
  Worn as thou wert with age, to me thou still
  Wast dear, and shalt be ever."
  Francklin's Sophocles
