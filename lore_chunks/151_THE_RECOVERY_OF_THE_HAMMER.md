THE RECOVERY OF THE HAMMER
  Once upon a time it happened that Thor's hammer fell into the
  possession of the giant Thrym, who buried it eight fathoms deep
  under the rocks of Jotunheim. Thor sent Loki to negotiate with
  Thrym, but he could only prevail so far as to get the giant's
  promise to restore the weapon if Freya would consent to be his
  bride. Loki returned and reported the result of his mission, but the
  goddess of love was quite horrified at the idea of bestowing her
  charms on the king of the Frost giants. In this emergency Loki
  persuaded Thor to dress himself in Freya's clothes and accompany him
  to Jotunheim. Thrym received his veiled bride with due courtesy, but
  was greatly surprised at seeing her eat for her supper eight salmons
  and a full grown ox, besides other delicacies, washing the whole
  down with three tuns of mead. Loki, however, assured him that she
  had not tasted anything for eight long nights, so great was her desire
  to see her lover, the renowned ruler of Jotunheim. Thrym had at length
  the curiosity to peep under his bride's veil, but started back in
  affright and demanded why Freya's eyeballs glistened with fire. Loki
  repeated the same excuse and the giant was satisfied. He ordered the
  hammer to be brought in and laid on the maiden's lap. Thereupon Thor
  threw off his disguise, grasped his redoubted weapon, and
  slaughtered Thrym and all his followers.
  Frey also possessed a wonderful weapon, a sword which would of
  itself spread a field with carnage whenever the owner desired it. Frey
  parted with this sword, but was less fortunate than Thor and never
  recovered it. It happened in this way: Frey once mounted Odin's
  throne, from whence one can see over the whole universe, and looking
  round saw far off in the giant's kingdom a beautiful maid, at the
  sight of whom he was struck with sudden sadness, insomuch that from
  that moment he could neither sleep, nor drink, nor speak. At last
  Skirnir, his messenger, drew his secret from him, and undertook to get
  him the maiden for his bride, if he would give him his sword as a
  reward. Frey consented and gave him the sword, and Skirnir set off
  on his journey and obtained the maiden's promise that within nine
  nights she would come to a certain place and there wed Frey. Skirnir
  having reported the success of his errand, Frey exclaimed:

  "Long is one night,
  Long are two nights,
  But how shall I hold out three?
  Shorter hath seemed
  A month to me oft
  Than of this longing time the half."

  So Frey obtained Gerda, the most beautiful of all women, for his
  wife, but he lost his sword.

  This story, entitled "Skirnir For," and the one immediately
  preceding it, "Thrym's Quida," will be found poetically told in
  Longfellow's "Poets and Poetry of Europe."
