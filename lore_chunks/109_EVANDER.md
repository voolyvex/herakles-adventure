EVANDER
  Such were the formidable allies that ranged themselves against
  AEneas. It was night and he lay stretched in sleep on the bank of
  the river under the open heavens. The god of the stream, Father Tiber.
  seemed to raise his head above the willows and to say, "O
  goddess-born, destined possessor of the Latin realms, this is the
  promised land, here is to be your home, here shall terminate the
  hostility of the heavenly powers, if only you faithfully persevere.
  There are friends not far distant. Prepare your boats and row up my
  stream; I will lead you to Evander, the Arcadian chief. He has long
  been at strife with Turnus and the Rutulians, and is prepared to
  become an ally of yours. Rise! offer your vows to Juno, and
  deprecate her anger. When you have achieved your victory then think of
  me." AEneas woke and paid immediate obedience to the friendly
  vision. He sacrificed to Juno, and invoked the god of the river and
  all his tributary fountains to lend their aid. Then for the first time
  a vessel filled with armed warriors floated on the stream of the
  Tiber. The river smoothed its waves, and bade its current flow gently,
  while, impelled by the vigorous strokes of the rowers, the vessels
  shot rapidly up the stream.
  About the middle of the day they came in sight of the scattered
  buildings of the infant town, where in after times the proud city of
  Rome grew, whose glory reached the skies. By chance the old king,
  Evander, was that day celebrating annual solemnities in honour of
  Hercules and all the gods. Pallas, his son, and all the chiefs of
  the little commonwealth stood by. When they saw the tall ship
  gliding onward near the wood, they were alarmed at the sight, and rose
  from the tables. But Pallas forbade the solemnities to be interrupted,
  and seizing a weapon, stepped forward to the river's bank. He called
  aloud, demanding who they were, and what their object. AEneas, holding
  forth an olive-branch, replied, "We are Trojans, friends to you, and
  enemies to the Rutulians. We seek Evander, and offer to join our
  arms with yours." Pallas, in amaze at the sound of so great a name,
  invited them to land, and when AEneas touched the shore he seized
  his hand, and held it long in friendly grasp. Proceeding through the
  wood, they joined the king and his party and were most favourably
  received. Seats were provided for them at the tables, and the repast
  proceeded.
