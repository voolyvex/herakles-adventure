SIMONIDES
  Simonides was one of the most prolific of the early poets of Greece,
  but only a few fragments of his compositions have descended to us.
  He wrote hymns, triumphal odes, and elegies. In the last species of
  composition he particularly excelled. His genius was inclined to the
  pathetic, and none could touch with truer effect the chords of human
  sympathy. The "Lamentation of Danae," the most important of the
  fragments which remain of his poetry, is based upon the tradition that
  Danae and her infant son were confined by order of her father,
  Acrisius, in a chest and set adrift on the sea. The chest floated
  towards the island of Seriphus, where both were rescued by Dictys, a
  fisherman, and carried to Polydectes, king of the country, who
  received and protected them. The child, Perseus, when grown up
  became a famous hero, whose adventures have been recorded in a
  previous chapter.
  Simonides passed much of his life at the courts of princes, and
  often employed his talents in panegyric and festal odes, receiving his
  reward from the munificence of those whose exploits he celebrated.
  This employment was not derogatory, but closely resembles that of
  the earliest bards, such as Demodocus, described by Homer, or of Homer
  himself, as recorded by tradition.
  On one occasion, when residing at the court of Scopas, king of
  Thessaly, the prince desired him to prepare a poem in celebration of
  his exploits, to be recited at a banquet. In order to diversify his
  theme, Simonides, who was celebrated for his piety, introduced into
  his poem the exploits of Castor and Pollux. Such digressions were
  not unusual with the poets on similar occasions, and one might suppose
  an ordinary mortal might have been content to share the praises of the
  sons of Leda. But vanity is exacting; and as Scopas sat at his
  festal board among his courtiers and sycophants, he grudged every
  verse that did not rehearse his own praises. When Simonides approached
  to receive the promised reward Scopas bestowed but half the expected
  sum, saying, "Here is payment for my portion of thy performance;
  Castor and Pollux will doubtless compensate thee for so much as
  relates to them." The disconcerted poet returned to his seat amidst
  the laughter which followed the great man's jest. In a little time
  he received a message that two young men on horseback were waiting
  without and anxious to see him. Simonides hastened to the door, but
  looked in vain for the visitors. Scarcely, however, had he left the
  banqueting hall when the roof fell in with a loud crash, burying
  Scopas and all his guests beneath the ruins. On inquiring as to the
  appearance of the young men who had sent for him, Simonides was
  satisfied that they were no other than Castor and Pollux themselves.
