ECHO AND NARCISSUS
  Echo was a beautiful nymph, fond of the woods and hills, where she
  devoted herself to woodland sports. She was a favourite of Diana,
  and attended her in the chase. But Echo had one failing; she was
  fond of talking, and whether in chat or argument, would have the
  last word. One day Juno was seeking her husband, who, she had reason
  to fear, was amusing himself among the nymphs. Echo by her talk
  contrived to detain the goddess till the nymphs made their escape.
  When Juno discovered it, she passed sentence upon Echo in these words:
  "You shall forfeit the use of that tongue with which you have
  cheated me, except for that one purpose you are so fond of- reply. You
  shall still have the last word, but no power to speak first."
  This nymph saw Narcissus, a beautiful youth, as he pursued the chase
  upon the mountains. She loved him and followed his footsteps. O how
  she longed to address him in the softest accents, and win him to
  converse! but it was not in her power. She waited with impatience
  for him to speak first, and had her answer ready. One day the youth,
  being separated from his companions, shouted aloud, "Who's here?" Echo
  replied, "Here." Narcissus looked around, but seeing no one, called
  out, "Come." Echo answered, "Come." As no one came, Narcissus called
  again, "Why do you shun me?" Echo asked the same question. "Let us
  join one another," said the youth. The maid answered with all her
  heart in the same words, and hastened to the spot, ready to throw
  her arms about his neck. He started back, exclaiming, "Hands off! I
  would rather die than you should have me!" "Have me," said she; but it
  was all in vain. He left her, and she went to hide her blushes in
  the recesses of the woods. From that time forth she lived in caves and
  among mountain cliffs. Her form faded with grief, till at last all her
  flesh shrank away. Her bones were changed into rocks and there was
  nothing left of her but her voice. With that she is still ready to
  reply to any one who calls her, and keeps up her old habit of having
  the last word.
  Narcissus's cruelty in this case was not the only instance. He
  shunned all the rest of the nymphs, as he had done poor Echo. One
  day a maiden who had in vain endeavoured to attract him uttered a
  prayer that he might some time or other feel what it was to love and
  meet no return of affection. The avenging goddess heard and granted
  the prayer.
  There was a clear fountain, with water like silver, to which the
  shepherds never drove their flocks, nor the mountain goats resorted,
  nor any of the beasts of the forests; neither was it defaced with
  fallen leaves or branches; but the grass grew fresh around it, and the
  rocks sheltered it from the sun. Hither came one day the youth,
  fatigued with hunting, heated and thirsty. He stooped down to drink,
  and saw his own image in the water; he thought it was some beautiful
  water-spirit living in the fountain. He stood gazing with admiration
  at those bright eyes, those locks curled like the locks of Bacchus
  or Apollo, the rounded cheeks, the ivory neck, the parted lips, and
  the glow of health and exercise over all. He fell in love with
  himself. He brought his lips near to take a kiss; he plunged his
  arms in to embrace the beloved object. It fled at the touch, but
  returned again after a moment and renewed the fascination. He could
  not tear himself away; he lost all thought of food or rest. while he
  hovered over the brink of the fountain gazing upon his own image. He
  talked with the supposed spirit: "Why, beautiful being, do you shun
  me? Surely my face is not one to repel you. The nymphs love me, and
  you yourself look not indifferent upon me. When I stretch forth my
  arms you do the same; and you smile upon me and answer my beckonings
  with the like." His tears fell into the water and disturbed the image.
  As he saw it depart, he exclaimed, "Stay, I entreat you! Let me at
  least gaze upon you, if I may not touch you." With this, and much more
  of the same kind, he cherished the flame that consumed him, so that by
  degrees be lost his colour, his vigour, and the beauty which
  formerly had so charmed the nymph Echo. She kept near him, however,
  and when he exclaimed, "Alas! alas! she answered him with the same
  words. He pined away and died; and when his shade passed the Stygian
  river, it leaned over the boat to catch a look of itself in the
  waters. The nymphs mourned for him, especially the water-nymphs; and
  when they smote their breasts Echo smote hers also. They prepared a
  funeral pile and would have burned the body, but it was nowhere to
  be found; but in its place a flower, purple within, and surrounded
  with white leaves, which bears the name and preserves the memory of
  Narcissus.
  Milton alludes to the story of Echo and Narcissus in the Lady's song
  in "Comus." She is seeking her brothers in the forest, and sings to
  attract their attention:

  "Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph, that liv'st unseen
  Within thy aery shell
  By slow Meander's margent green,
  And in the violet-embroidered vale,
  Where the love-lorn nightingale
  Nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well;
  Canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair
  That likest thy Narcissus are?
  O, if thou have
  Hid them in some flowery cave,
  Tell me but where,
  Sweet queen of parly, daughter of the sphere,
  So may'st thou be translated to the skies,
  And give resounding grace to all heaven's harmonies."

  Milton has imitated the story of Narcissus in the account which he
  makes Eve give of the first sight of herself reflected in the
  fountain.

  "That day I oft remember when from sleep
  I first awaked, and found myself reposed
  Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where
  And what I was, whence thither brought, and how
  Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
  Of waters issued from a cave, and spread
  Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved
  Pure as the expanse of heaven; I tither went
  With unexperienced thought, and laid me down
  On the green bank, to look into the clear
  Smooth lake that to me seemed another sky.
  As I bent down to look, just opposite
  A shape within the watery gleam appeared,
  Bending to look on me. I started back;
  It started back; but pleased I soon returned,
  Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks
  Of sympathy and love. There had I fixed
  Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire,
  Had not a voice thus warned me: 'What thou seest,
  What there thou seest, fair creature, is thyself;" etc.
  Paradise Lost, Book IV.

  No one of the fables of antiquity has been oftener alluded to by the
  poets than that of Narcissus. Here are two epigrams which treat it
  in different ways. The first is by Goldsmith:

  "ON A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH, STRUCK BLIND BY LIGHTNING.

  "Sure 'twas by Providence designed
  Rather in pity than in hate,
  That he should be like Cupid blind,
  To save him from Narcissus' fate."

  The other is by Cowper:

  "ON AN UGLY FELLOW.

  "Beware, my friend, of crystal brook
  Or fountain, lest that hideous hook,
  Thy nose, thou chance to see;
  Narcissus' fate would then be thine,
  And self-detested thou would'st pine,
  As self-enamoured he."
