THE PHOENIX
  Ovid tells the story of the Phoenix as follows: "Most beings
  spring from other individuals; but there is a certain kind which
  reproduces itself. The Assyrians call it the Phoenix. It does not live
  on fruit or flowers, but on frankincense and odoriferous gums. When it
  has lived five hundred years, it builds itself a nest in the
  branches of an oak, or on the top of a palm tree. In this it
  collects cinnamon, and spikenard, and myrrh, and of these 'materials
  builds a pile on which it deposits itself, and dying, breathes out its
  last breath amidst odours. From the body of the parent bird, a young
  Phoenix issues forth, destined to live as long a life as its
  predecessor. When this has grown up and gained sufficient strength, it
  lifts its nest from the tree (its own cradle and its parent's
  sepulchre), and carries it to the city of Heliopolis in Egypt, and
  deposits it in the temple of the Sun."
  Such is the account given by a poet. Now let us see that of a
  philosophic historian. Tacitus says, "in the consulship of Paulus
  Fabius (A.D. 34) the miraculous bird known to the world by the name of
  the Phoenix, after disappearing for a series of ages, revisited Egypt.
  It was attended in its flight by a group of various birds, all
  attracted by the novelty, and gazing with wonder at so beautiful an
  appearance." He then gives an account of the bird, not varying
  materially from the preceding, but adding some details. "The first
  care of the young bird as soon as fledged, and able to trust to his
  wings, is to perform the obsequies of his father. But this duty is not
  undertaken rashly. He collects a quantity of myrrh, and to try his
  strength makes frequent excursions with a load on his back. When he
  has gained sufficient confidence in his own vigour, he takes up the
  body of his father and flies with it to the altar of the Sun, where he
  leaves it to be consumed in flames of fragrance." Other writers add
  a few particulars. The myrrh is compacted in the form of an egg, in
  which the dead Phoenix is enclosed. From the mouldering flesh of the
  dead bird a worm springs, and this worm, when grown large, is
  transformed into a bird. Herodotus describes the bird, though he says,
  "I have not seen it myself, except in a picture. Part of his plumage
  is gold-coloured, and part crimson; and he is for the most part very
  much like an eagle in outline and bulk."
  The first writer who disclaimed a belief in the existence of the
  Phoenix was Sir Thomas Browne, in his "Vulgar Errors," published in
  1646. He was replied to a few years later by Alexander Ross, who says,
  in answer to the objection of the Phoenix so seldom making his
  appearance, "His instinct teaches him to keep out of the way of the
  tyrant of the creation, man, for if he were to be got at, some wealthy
  glutton would surely devour him, though there were no more in the
  world."

  Dryden in one of his early poems has this allusion to the Phoenix:

  "So when the new-born Phoenix first is seen
  Her feathered subjects all adore their queen,
  And while she makes her progress through the East,
  From every grove her numerous train 's increased;
  Each poet of the air her glory sings,
  And round him the pleased audience clap their wings."

  Milton, in "Paradise Lost," Book V., compares the angel Raphael
  descending to earth to a Phoenix:

  "...Down thither, prone in flight
  He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky
  Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing,
  Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan
  Winnows the buxom air; till within soar
  Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems
  A Phoenix, gazed by all; as that sole bird
  When, to enshrine his relics in the sun's
  Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies."
