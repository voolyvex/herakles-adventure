PERSEUS AND ATLAS
  After the slaughter of Medusa, Perseus, bearing with him the head of
  the Gorgon, flew far and wide, over land and sea. As night came on, he
  reached the western limit of the earth, where the sun goes down.
  Here he would gladly have rested till morning. It was the realm of
  King Atlas, whose bulk surpassed that of all other men. He was rich
  iii flocks and herds and had no neighbour or rival to dispute his
  state. But his chief pride was in his gardens whose fruit was of gold,
  hanging from golden branches, half hid with golden leaves. Perseus
  said to him, "I come as a guest. If you honour illustrious descent,
  I claim Jupiter for my father; if mighty deeds, I plead the conquest
  of the Gorgon. I seek rest and food." But Atlas remembered that an
  ancient prophecy had warned him that a son of Jove should one day
  rob him of His golden apples. So he answered, "Begone! or neither your
  false claims of glory nor parentage shall protect you;" and he
  attempted to thrust him out. Perseus, finding the giant too strong for
  him, said, "Since you value my friendship so little, deign to accept a
  present;" and turning his face away, he held up the Gorgon's head.
  Atlas, with all his bulk, was changed into stone. His beard and hair
  became forests, his arms and shoulders cliffs, his head a summit,
  and his bones rocks. Each part increased in bulk till be became a
  mountain, and (such was the pleasure of the gods) heaven with all
  its stars rests upon his shoulders.
