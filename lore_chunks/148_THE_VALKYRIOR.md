THE VALKYRIOR
  The Valkyrior are warlike virgins, mounted upon horses and armed
  with helmets and spears. Odin, who is desirous to collect a great many
  heroes in Valhalla, to be able to meet the giants in a day when the
  final contest must come, sends down to every battlefield to make
  choice of those who shall be slain. The Valkyrior are his
  messengers, and their name means "Choosers of the slain." When they
  ride forth on their errand, their armour sheds a strange flickering
  light, which flashes up over the northern skies, making what men
  call the "Aurora Borealis," or "Northern Lights."*

  * Gray's ode, "The Fatal Sisters," is founded on this superstition.
