OPENING THE GATES OF JANUS
  It was the custom of the country, when war was to be undertaken, for
  the chief magistrate, clad in his robes of office, with solemn pomp to
  open the gates of the temple of Janus, which were kept shut as long as
  peace endured. His people now urged the old king to perform that
  solemn office, but he refused to do so. While they contested, Juno
  herself, descending from the skies, smote the doors with
  irresistible force, and burst them open. Immediately the whole country
  was in a flame. The people rushed from every side breathing nothing
  but war.
  Turnus was recognized by all as leader; others joined as allies,
  chief of whom was Mezentius, a brave and able soldier, but of
  detestable cruelty. He had been the chief of one of the neighbouring
  cities, but his people drove him out. With him was joined his son
  Lausus, a generous youth, worthy of a better sire.
