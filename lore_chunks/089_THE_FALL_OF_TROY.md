THE FALL OF TROY
  THE story of the Iliad ends with the death of Hector, and it is from
  the Odyssey and later poems that we learn the fate of the other
  heroes. After the death of Hector, Troy did not immediately fall,
  but receiving aid from new allies still continued its resistance.
  One of these allies was Memnon, the AEthiopian prince, whose story
  we have already told. Another was Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons,
  who came with a band of female warriors. All the authorities attest
  their valour and the fearful effect of their war cry. Penthesilea slew
  many of the bravest warriors, but was at last slain by Achilles. But
  when the hero bent over his fallen foe, and contemplated her beauty,
  youth and valour, he bitterly regretted his victory. Thersites, an
  insolent brawler and demagogue, ridiculed his grief, and was in
  consequence slain by the hero.
  Achilles by chance had seen Polyxena, daughter of King Priam,
  perhaps on occasion of the truce which was allowed the Trojans for the
  burial of Hector. He was captivated with her charms, and to win her in
  marriage agreed to use his influence with the Greeks to grant peace to
  Troy. While in the temple of Apollo, negotiating the marriage, Paris
  discharged at him a poisoned arrow, which, guided by Apollo, wounded
  Achilles in the heel, the only vulnerable part about him. For Thetis
  his mother had dipped him when an infant in the river Styx, which made
  every part of him invulnerable except the heel by which she held him.*

  * The story of the invulnerability of Achilles is not found in
  Homer, and is inconsistent with his account. For how could Achilles
  require the aid of celestial armour if he were invulnerable?

  The body of Achilles so treacherously slain was rescued by Ajax
  and Ulysses. Thetis directed the Greeks to bestow her son's armour
  on the hero who of all the survivors should be judged most deserving
  of it. Ajax and Ulysses were the only claimants; a select number of
  the other chiefs were appointed to award the prize. It was awarded
  to Ulysses, thus placing wisdom before valour, whereupon Ajax slew
  himself. On the spot where his blood sank into the earth a flower
  sprang up, called the hyacinth, bearing on its leaves the first two
  letters of the name of Ajax, Ai, the Greek for "woe." Thus Ajax is a
  claimant with the boy Hyacinthus for the honour of giving birth to
  this flower. There is a species of Larkspur which represents the
  hyacinth of the poets in preserving the memory of this event, the
  Delphinium Ajacis- Ajax's Larkspur.
  It was now discovered that Troy could not be taken but by the aid of
  the arrows of Hercules. They were in possession of Philoctetes, the
  friend who had been with Hercules at the last and lighted his
  funeral pyre. Philoctetes had joined the Grecian expedition against
  Troy, but had accidentally wounded his foot with one of the poisoned
  arrows, and the smell from his wound proved so offensive that his
  companions carried him to the isle of Lemnos and left him there.
  Diomed was now sent to induce him to rejoin the army. He succeeded.
  Philoctetes was cured of his wound by Machaon, and Paris was the first
  victim of the fatal arrows. In his distress Paris bethought him of one
  whom in his prosperity he had forgotten. This was the nymph OEnone,
  whom he had married when a youth, and had abandoned for the fatal
  beauty Helen. OEnone remembering the wrongs she had suffered,
  refused to heal the wound, and Paris went back to Troy and died.
  OEnone quickly repented, and hastened after him with remedies, but
  came too late, and in her grief hung herself.*

  * Tennyson has chosen OEnone as the subject of a short poem; but
  he has omitted the most poetical part of the story, the return of
  Paris wounded, her cruelty and subsequent repentance.

  There was in Troy a celebrated statue of Minerva called the
  Palladium. It was said to have fallen from heaven, and the belief
  was that the city could not be taken so long as this statue remained
  within it. Ulysses and Diomed entered the city in disguise and
  succeeded in obtaining the Palladium, which they carried off to the
  Grecian camp.
  But Troy still held out, and the Greeks began to despair of ever
  subduing it by force, and by advice of Ulysses resolved to resort to
  stratagem. They pretended to be making preparations to abandon the
  siege, and a portion of the ships were withdrawn and lay hid behind
  a neighbouring island. The Greeks then constructed an immense wooden
  horse, which they gave out was intended as a propitiatory offering
  to Minerva, but in fact was filled with armed men. The remaining
  Greeks then betook themselves to their ships and sailed away, as if
  for a final departure. The Trojans, seeing the encampment broken up
  and the fleet gone, concluded the enemy to have abandoned the siege.
  The gates were thrown open, and the whole population issued forth
  rejoicing at the long-prohibited liberty of passing freely over the
  scene of the late encampment. The great horse was the chief object
  of curiosity. All wondered what it could be for. Some recommended to
  take it into the city as a trophy; others felt afraid of it.
  While they hesitate, Laocoon, the priest of Neptune, exclaims, "What
  madness, citizens, is this? Have you not learned enough of Grecian
  fraud to be on your guard against it? For my part, I fear the Greeks
  even when they offer gifts."* So saying he threw his lance at the
  horse's side. It struck, and a hollow sound reverberated like a groan.
  Then perhaps the people might have taken his advice and destroyed
  the fatal horse and all its contents; but just at that moment a
  group of people appeared, dragging forward one who seemed a prisoner
  and a Greek. Stupefied with terror, he was brought before the
  chiefs, who reassured him, promising that his life should be spared on
  condition of his returning true answers to the questions asked him. He
  informed them that he was a Greek, Sinon by name, and that in
  consequence of the malice of Ulysses he had been left behind by his
  countrymen at their departure. With regard to the wooden horse, he
  told them that it was a propitiatory offering to Minerva, and made
  so huge for the express purpose of preventing its being carried within
  the city; for Calchas the prophet had told them that if the Trojans
  took possession of it they would assuredly triumph over the Greeks.
  This language turned the tide of the people's feelings and they
  began to think how they might best secure the monstrous horse and
  the favourable auguries connected with it, when suddenly a prodigy
  occurred which left no room to doubt. There appeared, advancing over
  the sea, two immense serpents. They came upon the land, and the
  crowd fled in all directions. The serpents advanced directly to the
  spot where Laocoon stood with his two sons. They first attacked the
  children, winding round their bodies and breathing their
  pestilential breath in their faces. The father, attempting to rescue
  them, is next seized and involved in the serpents' coils. He struggles
  to tear them away, but they overpower all his efforts and strangle him
  and the children in their poisonous folds. This event was regarded
  as a clear indication of the displeasure of the gods at Laocoon's
  irreverent treatment of the wooden horse, which they no longer
  hesitated to regard as a sacred object, and prepared to introduce with
  due solemnity into the city. This was done with songs and triumphal
  acclamations, and the day closed with festivity. In the night the
  armed men who were enclosed in the body of the horse, being let out by
  the traitor Sinon, opened the gates of the city to their friends,
  who had returned under cover of the night. The city was set on fire;
  the people, overcome with feasting and sleep, put to the sword, and
  Troy completely subdued.

  One of the most celebrated groups of statuary in existence is that
  of Laocoon and his children in the embrace of the serpents. The
  original is in the Vatican at Rome. The following lines are from the
  "Childe Harold" of Byron:

  "Now turning to the Vatican go see
  Laocoon's torture dignifying pain;
  A father's love and mortal's agony
  With an immortal's patience blending;- vain
  The struggle! vain against the coiling strain
  And gripe and deepening of the dragon's grasp
  The old man's clinch; the long envenomed chain
  Rivets the living links; the enormous asp
  Enforces pang on pang and stifles gasp on gasp."

  The comic poets will also occasionally borrow a classical
  allusion. The following is from Swift's "Description of a City
  Shower":

  "Boxed in a chair the beau impatient sits,
  While spouts run clattering o'er the roof by fits,
  And ever and anon with frightful din
  The leather sounds; he trembles from within.
  So when Troy chairmen bore the wooden steed
  Pregnant with Greeks impatient to be freed,
  (Those bully Greeks, who, as the moderns do,
  Instead of paying chairmen, run them through);
  Laocoon struck the outside with a spear,
  And each imprisoned champion quaked with fear."

  King Priam lived to see the downfall of his kingdom and was slain at
  last on the fatal night when the Greeks took the city. He had armed
  himself and was about to mingle with the combatants, but was prevailed
  on by Hecuba, his aged queen, to take refuge with herself and his
  daughters as a suppliant at the altar of Jupiter. While there, his
  youngest son Polites, pursued by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles,
  rushed in wounded, and expired at the feet of his father; whereupon
  Priam, overcome with indignation, hurled his spear with feeble hand
  against Pyrrhus,* and was forthwith slain by him.

  * Pyrrhus's exclamation, "Not such aid nor such defenders does the
  time require," has become proverbial. See Proverbial Expressions,
  no. 7.

  Queen Hecuba and her daughter Cassandra were carried captives to
  Greece. Cassandra had been loved by Apollo, and he gave her the gift
  of prophecy; but afterwards offended with her, he rendered the gift
  unavailing by ordaining that her predictions should never be believed.
  Polyxena, another daughter, who had been loved by Achilles, was
  demanded by the ghost of that warrior, and was sacrificed by the
  Greeks upon his tomb.
