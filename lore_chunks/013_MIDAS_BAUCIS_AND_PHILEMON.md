MIDAS- BAUCIS AND PHILEMON
  BACCHUS, on a certain occasion, found his old schoolmaster and
  foster-father, Silenus, missing. The old man had been drinking, and in
  that state wandered away, and was found by some peasants, who
  carried him to their king, Midas. Midas recognized him, and treated
  him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with an
  unceasing round of jollity. On the eleventh day he brought Silenus
  back, and restored him in safety to his pupil. Whereupon Bacchus
  offered Midas his choice of a reward, whatever he might wish. He asked
  that whatever he might touch should be changed into gold. Bacchus
  consented, though sorry that he had not made a better choice. Midas
  went his way, rejoicing in his new-acquired power, which he hastened
  to put to the test. He could scarce believe his eyes when he found a
  twig of an oak, which he plucked from the branch, become gold in his
  hand. He took up a stone; it changed to gold. He touched a sod; it did
  the same. He took up an apple from the tree; you would have thought he
  had robbed the garden of the Hesperides. His joy knew no bounds, and
  as soon as he got home, he ordered the servants to set a splendid
  repast on the table. Then he found to his dismay that whether he
  touched bread, it hardened in his hand; or put a morsel to his lip, it
  defied his teeth. He took a glass of wine, but it flowed down his
  throat like melted gold.
  In consternation at the unprecedented affliction, he strove to
  divest himself of his power; he hated the gift he had lately
  coveted. But all in vain; starvation seemed to await him. He raised
  his arms, all shining with gold, in prayer to Bacchus, begging to be
  delivered from his glittering destruction. Bacchus, merciful deity,
  herd and consented. "Go," said he, "to River Pactolus, trace its
  fountain-head, there plunge yourself and body in, and wash away your
  fault and its punishment." He did so, and scarce had he touched the
  waters before the gold-creating power passed into them, and the
  river sands became changed into gold, as they remain to this day.
  Thenceforth Midas, hating wealth and splendour, dwelt in the
  country, and became a worshipper of Pan, the god of the fields. On a
  certain occasion Pan had the temerity to compare his music with that
  of Apollo, and to challenge the god of the lyre to a trial of skill.
  The challenge was accepted, and Tmolus, the mountain god, was chosen
  umpire. The senior took his seat, and cleared away the trees from
  his ears to listen. At a given signal Pan blew on his pipes, and
  with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his
  faithful follower Midas, who happened to be present. Then Tmolus
  turned his head toward the Sun-god, and all his trees turned with him.
  Apollo rose, his brow wreathed with Parnassian laurel, while his
  robe of Tyrian purple swept the ground. In his left hand he held the
  lyre, and with his right hand struck the strings. Ravished with the
  harmony, Tmolus at once awarded the victory to the god of the lyre,
  and all but Midas acquiesced in the judgment. He dissented, and
  questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a
  depraved pair of ears any longer to wear the human form, but caused
  them to increase in length, grow hairy, within and without, and
  movable on their roots; in short, to be on the perfect pattern of
  those of an ass.
  Mortified enough was King Midas at this mishap: but he consoled
  himself with the thought that it was possible to hide his
  misfortune, which he attempted to do by means of an ample turban or
  head-dress. But his hair-dresser of course knew the secret. He was
  charged not to mention it, and threatened with dire punishment if he
  presumed to disobey. But he found it too much for his discretion to
  keep such a secret; so he went out into the meadow, dug a hole in
  the ground, and stooping down, whispered the story, and covered it up.
  Before long a thick bed of reeds sprang up in the meadow, and as
  soon as it had gained its growth, began whispering the story, and
  has continued to do so, from that day to this, every time a breeze
  passes over the place.

  The story of King Midas has been told by others with some
  variations. Dryden, in the "Wife of Bath's Tale," makes Midas's
  queen the betrayer of the secret:

  "This Midas knew, and durst communicate
  To none but to his wife his ears of state."

  Midas was king of Phrygia. He was the son of Gordius, a poor
  countryman, who was taken by the people and made king, in obedience to
  the command of the oracle, which had said that their future king
  should come in a wagon. While the people were deliberating, Gordius
  with his wife and son came driving his wagon into the public square.
  Gordius, being made king, dedicated his wagon to the deity of the
  oracle, and tied it up in its place with a fast knot. This was the
  celebrated Gordian knot, which, in after times it was said, whoever
  should untie should become lord of all Asia. Many tried to untie it,
  but none succeeded, till Alexander the Great, in his career of
  conquest, came to Phrygia. He tried his skill with as ill success as
  others, till growing impatient he drew his sword and cut the knot.
  When he afterwards succeeded in subjecting all Asia to his sway,
  people began to think that he had complied with the terms of the
  oracle according to its true meaning.
