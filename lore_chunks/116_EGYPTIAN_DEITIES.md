EGYPTIAN DEITIES
  The Egyptians acknowledged as the highest deity Amun, afterwards
  called Zeus, or Jupiter Ammon. Amun manifested himself in his word
  or will, which created Kneph and Athor, of different sexes. From Kneph
  and Athor proceeded Osiris and Isis. Osiris was worshipped as the
  god of the sun, the source of warmth, life, and fruitfulness, in
  addition to which he was also regarded as the god of the Nile, who
  annually visited his wife, Isis (the Earth), by means of an
  inundation. Serapis or Hermes is sometimes represented as identical
  with Osiris, and sometimes as a distinct divinity, the ruler of
  Tartarus and god of medicine. Anubis is the guardian god,
  represented with a dog's head, emblematic of his character of fidelity
  and watchfulness. Horus or Harpocrates was the son of Osiris. He is
  represented seated on a Lotus flower, with his finger on his lips,
  as the god of Silence.
  In one of Moore's "Irish Melodies" is an allusion to Harpocrates:

  "Thyself shall, under some rosy bower,
  Sit mute, with thy finger on thy lip;
  Like him, the boy, who born among
  The flowers that on the Nile-stream blush,
  Sits ever thus,- his only song
  To Earth and Heaven, 'Hush all, hush!"
