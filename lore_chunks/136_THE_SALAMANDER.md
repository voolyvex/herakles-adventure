THE SALAMANDER
  The following is from the "Life of Benvenuto Cellini," an Italian
  artist of the sixteenth century, written by himself: "When I was about
  five years of age, my father, happening to be in a little room in
  which they had been washing, and where there was a good fire of oak
  burning, looked into the flames and saw a little animal resembling a
  lizard, which could live in the hottest part of that element.
  Instantly perceiving what it was, he called for my sister and me,
  and after he had shown us the creature, he gave me a box on the ear. I
  fell a-crying, while he, soothing me with caresses, spoke these words:
  'My dear child, I do not give you that blow for any fault you have
  committed, but that you may recollect that the little creature you see
  in the fire is a salamander; such a one as never was beheld before
  to my knowledge.' So saying he embraced me, and gave me some money."
  It seems unreasonable to doubt a story of which Signor Cellini was
  both an eye and ear witness. Add to which the authority of numerous
  sage philosophers, at the head of whom are Aristotle and Pliny,
  affirms this power of the salamander. According to them, the animal
  not only resists fire, but extinguishes it, and when he sees the flame
  charges it as an enemy which he well knows how to vanquish.
  That the skin of an animal which could resist the action of fire
  should be considered proof against that element is not to be
  wondered at. We accordingly find that a cloth made of the skin of
  salamanders (for there really is such an animal, a kind of lizard) was
  incombustible, and very valuable, for wrapping up such articles as
  were too precious to be intrusted to any other envelopes. These
  fire-proof cloths were actually produced, said to be made of
  salamander's wool, though the knowing ones detected that the substance
  of which they were composed was asbestos, a mineral, which is in
  fine filaments capable of being woven into a flexible cloth.
  The foundation of the above fables is supposed to be the fact that
  the salamander really does secrete from the pores of his body a
  milky juice, which when he is irritated is produced in considerable
  quantity, and would doubtless, for a few moments, defend the body from
  fire. Then it is a hibernating animal, and in winter retires to some
  hollow tree or other cavity, where it coils itself up and remains in a
  torpid state till the spring again calls it forth. It may therefore
  sometimes be carried with the fuel to the fire, and wake up only
  time enough to put forth all its faculties for its defence. Its
  viscous juice would do good service, and all who profess to have
  seen it, acknowledge that it got out of the fire as fast as its legs
  could carry it; indeed, too fast for them ever to make prize of one,
  except in one instance, and in that one the animal's feet and some
  parts of its body were badly burned.

  Dr. Young, in the "Night Thoughts," with more quaintness than good
  taste, compares the sceptic who can remain unmoved in the
  contemplation of the starry heavens to a salamander unwarmed in the
  fire:

  "An undevout astronomer is mad!

  . . . . . . .

  "O, what a genius must inform the skies!
  And is Lorenzo's salamander-heart
  Cold and untouched amid these sacred fires?"
