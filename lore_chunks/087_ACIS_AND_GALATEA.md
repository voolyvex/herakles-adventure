ACIS AND GALATEA
  Scylla was a fair virgin of Sicily, a favourite of the Sea-Nymphs.
  She had many suitors, but repelled them all, and would go to the
  grotto of Galatea, and tell her how she was persecuted. One day the
  goddess, while Scylla dressed her hair, listened to the story, and
  then replied, "Yet, maiden, your persecutors are of the not ungentle
  race of men, whom, if you will, you can repel; but I, the daughter
  of Nereus, and protected by such a band of sisters, found no escape
  from the passion of the Cyclops but in the depths of the sea;" and
  tears stopped her utterance, which when the pitying maiden had wiped
  away with her delicate finger, and soothed the goddess, "Tell me,
  dearest," said she, "the cause of your grief." Galatea then said,
  "Acis was the son of Faunus, and a Naiad. His father and mother
  loved him dearly, but their love was not equal to mine. For the
  beautiful youth attached himself to me alone, and he was just
  sixteen years old, the down just beginning to darken his cheeks. As
  much as I sought his society, so much did the Cyclops seek mine; and
  if you ask me whether my love for Acis or my hatred of Polyphemus
  was the stronger, I cannot tell you; they were in equal measure. O
  Venus, how great is thy power! this fierce giant, the terror of the
  woods, whom no hapless stranger escaped unharmed, who defied even Jove
  himself, learned to feel what love was, and, touched with a passion
  for me, forgot his flocks and his well-stored caverns. Then for the
  first time he began to take some care of his appearance, and to try to
  make himself agreeable; he harrowed those coarse locks of his with a
  comb, and mowed his beard with a sickle, looked at his harsh
  features in the water, and composed his countenance. His love of
  slaughter, his fierceness and thirst of blood prevailed no more, and
  ships that touched at his island went away in safety. He paced up
  and down the sea-shore, imprinting huge tracks with his heavy tread,
  and, when weary, lay tranquilly in his cave.
  "There is a cliff which projects into the sea, which washes it on
  either side. Thither one day the huge Cyclops ascended, and sat down
  while his flocks spread themselves around. Laying down his staff,
  which would have served for a mast to hold a vessel's sail, and taking
  his instrument compacted of numerous pipes, he made the hills and
  the waters echo the music of his song. I lay hid under a rock by the
  side of my beloved Acis, and listened to the distant strain. It was
  full of extravagant praises of my beauty, mingled with passionate
  reproaches of my coldness and cruelty.
  "When he had finished he rose up, and, like a raging bull that
  cannot stand still, wandered off into the woods. Acis and I thought no
  more of him, till on a sudden he came to a spot which gave him a
  view of us as we sat. 'I see you,' he exclaimed, 'and I will make this
  the last of your love-meetings.' His voice was a roar such as an angry
  Cyclops alone could utter. AEtna trembled at the sound. I, overcome
  with terror, plunged into the water. Acis turned and fled, crying,
  'Save me, Galatea, save me, my parents!' The Cyclops pursued him,
  and tearing a rock from the side of the mountain hurled it at him.
  Though only a corner of it touched him, it overwhelmed him.
  "All that fate left in my power I did for Acis. I endowed him with
  the honours of his grandfather, the river-god. The purple blood flowed
  out from under the rock, but by degrees grew paler and looked like the
  stream of a river rendered turbid by rains, and in time it became
  clear. The rock cleaved open, and the water, as it gushed from the
  chasm, uttered a pleasing murmur."
  Thus Acis was changed into a river, and the river retains the name
  of Acis.

  Dryden, in his "Cymon and Iphigenia," has told the story of a
  clown converted into a gentleman by the power of love, in a way that
  shows traces of kindred to the old story of Galatea and the Cyclops.

  "What not his father's care nor tutor's art
  Could plant with pains in his unpolished heart,
  The best instructor, Love, at once inspired,
  As barren grounds to fruitfulness are fired.
  Love taught him shame, and shame with love at strife
  Soon taught the sweet civilities of life."
