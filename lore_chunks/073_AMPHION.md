AMPHION
  Amphion was the son of Jupiter and Antiope, queen of Thebes. With
  his twin brother Zethus, he was exposed at birth on Mount Cithaeron,
  where they grew up among the shepherds, not knowing their parentage.
  Mercury gave Amphion a lyre and taught him to play upon it, and his
  brother occupied himself in hunting and tending the flocks.
  Meanwhile Antiope, their mother, who had been treated with great
  cruelty by Lycus, the usurping king of Thebes, and by Dirce, his wife,
  found means to inform her children of their rights and to summon
  them to her assistance. With a band of their fellow-herdsmen they
  attacked and slew Lycus, and tying Dirce by the hair of her head to
  a bull, let him drag her till she was dead.* Amphion, having become
  king of Thebes, fortified the city with a wall. It is said that when
  he played on his lyre the stones moved of their own accord and took
  their places in the wall.
  See Tennyson's poem of "Amphion" for an amusing use made of this
  story.

  * The punishment of Dirce is the subject of a celebrated group of
  statuary now in the Museum at Naples.
