NIOBE
  The fate of Arachne was noised abroad through all the country, and
  served as a warning to all presumptuous mortals not to compare
  themselves with the divinities. But one, and she a matron too,
  failed to learn the lesson of humility. It was Niobe, the queen of
  Thebes. She had indeed much to be proud of; but it was not her
  husband's fame, nor her own beauty, nor their great descent, nor the
  power of their kingdom that elated her. It was her children; and truly
  the happiest of mothers would Niobe have been if only she had not
  claimed to be so. It was on occasion of the annual celebration in
  honour of Latona and her offspring, Apollo and Diana,- when the people
  of Thebes were assembled, their brows crowned with laurel, bearing
  frankincense to the altars and paying their vows,- that Niobe appeared
  among the crowd. Her attire was splendid with gold and gems, and her
  aspect beautiful as the face of an angry woman can be. She stood and
  surveyed the people with haughty looks. "What folly," said she, "is
  this!- to prefer beings whom you never saw to those who stand before
  your eyes! Why should Latona be honoured with worship, and none be
  paid to me? My father was Tantalus, who was received as a guest at the
  table of the gods; my mother was a goddess. My husband built and rules
  this city, Thebes, and Phrygia is my paternal inheritance. Wherever
  I turn my eyes I survey the elements of my power; nor is my form and
  presence unworthy of a goddess. To all this let me add I have seven
  sons and seven daughters, and look for sons-in-law and
  daughters-in-law of pretensions worthy of my alliance. Have I not
  cause for pride? Will you prefer to me this Latona, the Titan's
  daughter, with her two children? I have seven times as many. Fortunate
  indeed am I, and fortunate I shall remain! Will any one deny this?
  My abundance is my security. I feel myself too strong for Fortune to
  subdue. She may take from me much; I shall still have much left.
  Were I to lose some of my children, I should hardly be left as poor as
  Latona with her two only. Away with you from these solemnities,- put
  off the laurel from your brows,- have done with this worship!" The
  people obeyed, and left the sacred services uncompleted.
  The goddess was indignant. On the Cynthian mountain top where she
  dwelt she thus addressed her son and daughter: "My children, I who
  have been so proud of you both, and have been used to hold myself
  second to none of the goddesses except Juno alone, begin now to
  doubt whether I am indeed a goddess. I shall be deprived of my worship
  altogether unless you protect me." She was proceeding in this
  strain, but Apollo interrupted her. "Say no more," said he; "speech
  only delays punishment." So said Diana also. Darting through the
  air, veiled in clouds, they alighted on the towers of the city. Spread
  out before the gates was a broad plain, where the youth of the city
  pursued their warlike sports. The sons of Niobe were there with the
  rest,- some mounted on spirited horses richly caparisoned, some
  driving gay chariots, Ismenos, the first-born, as he guided his
  foaming steeds, struck with an arrow from above, cried out, "Ah me!"
  dropped the reins, and fell lifeless. Another, hearing the sound of
  the bow,- like the boatman who sees the storm gathering and makes
  all sail for the port,- gave the reins to his horses and attempted
  to escape. The inevitable arrow overtook him, as he fled. Two
  others, younger boys, just from their tasks, had gone to the
  playground to have a game of wrestling. As they stood breast to
  breast, one arrow pierced them both. They uttered a cry together,
  together cast a parting look around them, and together breathed
  their last. Alphenor, an elder brother, seeing them fall, hastened
  to the spot to render assistance, and fell stricken in the act of
  brotherly duty. One only was left, Ilioneus. He raised his arms to
  heaven to try whether prayer might not avail. "Spare me, ye gods!"
  he cried, addressing all, in his ignorance that all needed not his
  intercessions; and Apollo would have spared him, but the arrow had
  already left the string, and it was too late.
  The terror of the people and grief of the attendants soon made Niobe
  acquainted with what had taken place. She could hardly think it
  possible; she was indignant that the gods had dared, and amazed that
  they had been able to do it. Her husband, Amphion, overwhelmed with
  the blow, destroyed himself. Alas! how different was this Niobe from
  her who had so lately driven away the people from the sacred rites,
  and held her stately course through the city, the envy of her friends,
  now the pity even of her foes! She knelt over the lifeless bodies, and
  kissed now one, now another of her dead sons. Raising her pallid
  arms to heaven, "Cruel Latona," said she, "feed full your rage with my
  anguish! Satiate your hard heart, while I follow to the grave my seven
  sons. Yet where is your triumph? Bereaved as I am, I am still richer
  than you, my conqueror." Scarce had she spoken, when the bow sounded
  and struck terror into all hearts except Niobe's alone. She was
  brave from excess of grief, The sisters stood in garments of
  mourning over the biers of their dead brothers. One fell, struck by an
  arrow, and died on the corpse she was bewailing. Another, attempting
  to console her mother, suddenly ceased to speak, and sank lifeless
  to the earth. A third tried to escape by flight, a fourth by
  concealment, another stood trembling, uncertain what course to take.
  Six were now dead, and only one remained, whom the mother held clasped
  in her arms, and covered as it were with her whole body. "Spare me
  one, and that the youngest! O spare me one of so many!" she cried; and
  while she spoke, that one fell dead. Desolate she sat, among sons,
  daughters, husband, all dead, and seemed torpid with grief. The breeze
  moved not her hair, no colour was on her cheek, her eyes glared
  fixed and immovable, there was no sign of life about her. Her very
  tongue cleaved to the roof of her mouth, and her veins ceased to
  convey the tide of life. Her neck bent not, her arms made no
  gesture, her foot no step. She was changed to stone, within and
  without. Yet tears continued to flow; and borne on a whirlwind to
  her native mountain, she still remains, a mass of rock, from which a
  trickling stream flows, the tribute of her never-ending grief.

  The story of Niobe has furnished Byron with a fine illustration of
  the fallen condition of modern Rome:

  "The Niobe of nations! there she stands,
  Childless and crownless in her voiceless woe;
  An empty urn within her withered hands,
  Whose holy dust was scattered long ago;
  The Scipios' tomb contains no ashes now:
  The very sepulchres lie tenantless
  Of their heroic dwellers; dost thou flow,
  Old Tiber! through a marble wilderness?
  Rise with thy yellow waves, and mantle her distress."
  Childe Harold, IV. 79.

  As an illustration of this story there is a celebrated statue in the
  imperial gallery of Florence. It is the principal figure of a group
  supposed to have been originally arranged in the pediment of a temple.
  The figure of the mother clasped by the arm of her terrified child
  is one of the most admired of the ancient statues. It ranks with the
  Laocoon and the Apollo among the masterpieces of art. The following is
  a translation of a Greek epigram supposed to relate to this statue:

  "To stone the gods have changed her, but in vain;
  The sculptor's art has made her breathe again."

  Tragic as is the Story of Niobe, we cannot forbear to smile at the
  use Moore has made of it in "Rhymes on the Road":

  "'Twas in his carriage the sublime
  Sir Richard Blackmore used to rhyme,
  And, if the wits don't do him wrong,
  'Twixt death and epics passed his time,
  Scribbling and killing all day long;
  Like Phoebus in his car at ease,
  Now warbling forth a lofty song,
  Now murdering the young Niobes."

  Sir Richard Blackmore was a physician, and at same time a very
  prolific and very tasteless poet, whose works are now forgotten,
  unless when recalled to mind by some wit like Moore for the sake of
  a joke.
