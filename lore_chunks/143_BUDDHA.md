BUDDHA
  Buddha, whom the Vedas represent as a delusive incarnation of
  Vishnu, is said by his followers to have been a mortal sage, whose
  name was Gautama, called also by the complimentary epithets of
  Sakyasinha, the Lion, and Buddha, the Sage.
  By a comparison of the various epochs assigned to his birth, it is
  inferred that he lived about one thousand years before Christ.
  He was the son of a king; and when in conformity to the usage of the
  country he was, a few days after his birth, presented before the altar
  of a deity, the image is said to have inclined its head as a presage
  of the future greatness of the new-born prophet. The child soon
  developed faculties of the first order, and became equally
  distinguished by the uncommon beauty of his person. No sooner had he
  grown to years of maturity than he began to reflect deeply on the
  depravity and misery of mankind, and he conceived the idea of retiring
  from society and devoting himself to meditation. His father in vain
  opposed this design. Buddha escaped the vigilance of his guards, and
  having found a secure retreat, lived for six years undisturbed in
  his devout contemplations. At the expiration of that period he came
  forward at Benares as a religious teacher. At first some who heard him
  doubted of the soundness of his mind; but his doctrines soon gained
  credit, and were propagated so rapidly that Buddha himself lived to
  see them spread all over India. He died at the age of eighty years.
  The Buddhists reject entirely the authority of the Vedas, and the
  religious observances prescribed in them and kept by the Hindus.
  They also reject the distinction of castes, and prohibit all bloody
  sacrifices, and allow animal food. Their priests are chosen from all
  classes; they are expected to procure their maintenance by
  perambulation and begging, and among other things it is their duty
  to endeavour to turn to some use things thrown aside as useless by
  others, and to discover the medicinal power of plants. But in Ceylon
  three orders of priests are recognized; those of the highest order are
  usually men of high birth and learning, and are supported at the
  principal temples, most of which have been richly endowed by the
  former monarchs of the country.
  For several centuries after the appearance of buddha, his sect seems
  to have been tolerated by the Brahmans, and Buddhism appears to have
  penetrated the peninsula of Hindustan in every direction, and to
  have been carried to Ceylon, and to the eastern peninsula. But
  afterwards it had to endure in India a long-continued persecution,
  which ultimately had the effect of entirely abolishing it in the
  country where it had originated, but to scatter it widely over
  adjacent countries. Buddhism appears to have been introduced into
  China about the year 65 of our era. From China it was subsequently
  extended to Corea, Japan, and Java.
