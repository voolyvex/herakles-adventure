ADVENTURES OF AENEAS
  WE have followed one of the Grecian heroes, Ulysses, in his
  wanderings on his return home from Troy, and now we propose to share
  the fortunes of the remnant of the conquered people, under their chief
  AEneas, in their search for a new home, after the ruin of their native
  city. On that fatal night when the wooden horse disgorged its contents
  of armed men, and the capture and conflagration of the city were the
  result, AEneas made his escape from the scene of destruction, with his
  father, and his wife, and young son. The father, Anchises, was too old
  to walk with the speed required, and AEneas took him upon his
  shoulders.* Thus burdened, leading his son and followed by his wife,
  he made the best of his way out of the burning city; but, in the
  confusion, his wife was swept away and lost.

  On arriving at the place of rendezvous, numerous fugitives, of
  both sexes, were found, who put themselves under the guidance of
  AEneas. Some months were spent in preparation, and at length they
  embarked. They first landed on the neighboring shores of Thrace, and
  were preparing to build a city, but AEneas was deterred by a
  prodigy. Preparing to offer sacrifice, he tore some twigs from one
  of the bushes. To his dismay the wounded part dropped blood. When he
  repeated the act a voice from the ground cried out to him, "Spare
  me, AEneas; I am your kinsman, Polydore, here murdered with many
  arrows, from which a bush has grown, nourished with my blood." These
  words recalled to the recollection of AEneas that Polydore was a young
  prince of Troy, whom his father had sent with ample treasures to the
  neighbouring land of Thrace, to be there brought up, at a distance
  from the horrors of war. The king to whom he was sent had murdered him
  and seized his treasures. AEneas and his companions, considering the
  land accursed by the stain of such a crime, hastened away.
  They next landed on the island of Delos, which was once a floating
  island, till Jupiter fastened it by adamantine chains to the bottom of
  the sea. Apollo and Diana were born there, and the island was sacred
  to Apollo. Here AEneas consulted the oracle of Apollo, and received an
  answer, ambiguous as usual,- "Seek your ancient mother; there the race
  of AEneas shall dwell, and reduce all other nations to their sway."
  The Trojans heard with joy and immediately began to ask one another,
  "Where is the spot intended by the oracle?" Anchises remembered that
  there was a tradition that their forefathers came from Crete and
  thither they resolved to steer. They arrived at Crete and began to
  build their city, but sickness broke out among them, and the fields
  that they had planted failed to yield a crop. In this gloomy aspect of
  affairs AEneas was warned in a dream to leave the country and seek a
  western land, called Hesperia, whence Dardanus, the true founder of
  the Trojan race, had originally migrated. To Hesperia, now called
  Italy, therefore, they directed their future course, and not till
  after many adventures and the lapse of time sufficient to carry a
  modern navigator several times round the world, did they arrive there.
  Their first landing was at the island of the Harpies. These were
  disgusting birds with the heads of maidens, with long claws and
  faces pale with hunger. They were sent by the gods to torment a
  certain Phineus, whom Jupiter had deprived of his sight, in punishment
  of his cruelty; and whenever a meal was placed before him the
  Harpies darted down from the air and carried it off. They were
  driven away from Phineus by the heroes of the Argonautic expedition,
  and took refuge in the island where AEneas now found them.
  When they entered the port the Trojans saw herds of cattle roaming
  over the plain. They slew as many as they wished and prepared for a
  feast. But no sooner had they seated themselves at the table than a
  horrible clamour was heard in the air, and a flock of these odious
  harpies came rushing down upon them, seizing in their talons the
  meat from the dishes and flying away with it. AEneas and his
  companions drew their swords and dealt vigorous blows among the
  monsters, but to no purpose, for they were so nimble it was almost
  impossible to hit them, and their feathers were like armour
  impenetrable to steel. One of them, perched on a neighbouring cliff,
  screamed out, "Is it thus, Trojans, you treat us innocent birds, first
  slaughter our cattle and then make war on ourselves?" She then
  predicted dire sufferings to them in their future course, and having
  vented her wrath flew away. The Trojans made haste to leave the
  country, and next found themselves coasting along the shore of Epirus.
  Here they landed, and to their astonishment learned that certain
  Trojan exiles, who had been carried there as prisoners, had become
  rulers of the country. Andromache, the widow of Hector, became the
  wife of one of the victorious Grecian chiefs, to whom she bore a
  son. Her husband dying, she was left regent of the country, as
  guardian of her son, and had married a fellow-captive, Helenus, of the
  royal race of Troy. Helenus and Andromache treated the exiles with the
  utmost hospitality, and dismissed them loaded with gifts.
  From hence AEneas coasted along the shore of Sicily and passed the
  country of the Cyclopses. Here they were hailed from the shore by a
  miserable object, whom by his garments, tattered as they were, they
  perceived to be a Greek. He told them he was one of Ulysses'
  companions, left behind by that chief in his hurried departure. He
  related the story of Ulysses' adventure with Polyphemus, and
  besought them to take him off with them as he had no means of
  sustaining his existence where he was but wild berries and roots,
  and lived in constant fear of the Cyclopses, While he spoke Polyphemus
  made his appearance; "a terrible monster, shapeless, vast, whose
  only eye had been put out."* He walked with cautious steps, feeling
  his way with a staff, down to the seaside, to wash his eye-socket in
  the waves. When he reached the water, he waded out towards them, and
  his immense height enabled him to advance far into the sea, so that
  the Trojans, in terror, took to their oars to get out of his way.
  Hearing the oars, Polyphemus shouted after them, so that the shores
  resounded, and at the noise the other Cyclopses came forth from
  their caves and woods and lined the shore, like a row of lofty pine
  trees. The Trojans plied their oars and soon left them out of sight.

  AEneas had been cautioned by Helenus to avoid the strait guarded
  by the monsters Scylla and Charybdis. There Ulysses, the reader will
  remember, had lost six of his men, seized by Scylla while the
  navigators were wholly intent upon avoiding Charybdis. AEneas,
  following the advice of Helenus, shunned the dangerous pass and
  coasted along the island of Sicily.
  Juno, seeing the Trojans speeding their way prosperously towards
  their destined shore, felt her old grudge against them revive, for she
  could not forget the slight that Paris had put upon her, in awarding
  the prize of beauty to another. "In heavenly minds can such
  resentments dwell!"* Accordingly she hastened to AEolus, the ruler
  of the winds,- the same who supplied Ulysses with favouring gales,
  giving him the contrary ones tied up in a bag AEolus obeyed the
  goddess and sent forth his sons, Boreas, Typhon, and the other
  winds, to toss the ocean. A terrible storm ensued and the Trojan ships
  were driven out of their course towards the coast of Africa. They were
  in imminent danger of being wrecked, and were separated, so that
  AEneas thought that all were lost except his own.

  At this crisis, Neptune, hearing the storm raging, and knowing
  that he had given no orders for one. raised his head above the
  waves, and saw the fleet of AEneas driving before the gale. Knowing
  the hostility of Juno, he was at no loss to account for it, but his
  anger was not the less at this interference in his province. He called
  the winds and dismissed them with a severe reprimand. He then
  soothed the waves, and brushed away the clouds from before the face of
  the sun. Some of the ships which had got on the rocks he prised off
  with his own trident, while Triton and a sea-nymph, putting their
  shoulders under others, set them afloat again. The Trojans, when the
  sea became calm, sought the nearest shore, which was the coast of
  Carthage, where AEneas was so happy as to find that one by one the
  ships all arrived safe, though badly shaken.

  Waller, in his "Panegyric to the Lord Protector" (Cromwell), alludes
  to this stilling of the storm by Neptune:

  "Above the waves, as Neptune showed his face,
  To chide the winds and save the Trojan race,
  So has your Highness, raised above the rest,
  Storms of ambition tossing us repressed."
