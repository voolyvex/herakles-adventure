DRYOPE
  Dryope and Iole were sisters. The former was the wife of
  Andraemon, beloved by her husband, and happy in the birth of her first
  child. One day the sisters strolled to the bank of a stream that
  sloped gradually down to the water's edge, while the upland was
  overgrown with myrtles. They were intending to gather flowers for
  forming garlands for the altars of the nymphs, and Dryope carried
  her child at her bosom, precious burden, and nursed him as she walked.
  Near the water grew a lotus plant, full of purple flowers. Dryope
  gathered some and offered them to the baby, and Iole was about to do
  the same, when she perceived blood dropping from the places where
  her sister had broken them off the stem. The plant was no other than
  the nymph Lotis, who, running from a base pursuer, had been changed
  into this form. This they learned from the country people when it
  was too late.
  Dryope, horror-struck when she perceived what she had done, would
  gladly have hastened from the spot, but found her feet rooted to the
  ground. She tried to pull them away, but moved nothing but her upper
  limbs. The woodiness crept upward and by degrees invested her body. In
  anguish she attempted to tear her hair, but found her hands filled
  with leaves. The infant felt his mother's bosom begin to harden, and
  the milk cease to flow. Iole looked on at the sad fate of her
  sister, and could render no assistance. She embraced the growing
  trunk, as if she would hold back the advancing wood, and would
  gladly have been enveloped in the same bark. At this moment Andraemon,
  the husband of Dryope, with her father, approached; and when they
  asked for Dryope, Iole pointed them to the new-formed lotus. They
  embraced the trunk of the yet warm tree, and showered their kisses
  on its leaves.
  Now there was nothing left of Dryope but her face. Her tears still
  flowed and fell on her leaves, and while she could she spoke. "I am
  not guilty. I deserve not this fate. I have injured no one. If I speak
  falsely, may my foliage perish with drought and my trunk be cut down
  and burned. Take this infant and give it to a nurse. Let it often be
  brought and nursed under my branches, and play in my shade; and when
  he is old enough to talk, let him be taught to call me mother, and
  to say with sadness, 'My mother lies hid under this bark.' But bid him
  be careful of river banks, and beware how he plucks flowers,
  remembering that every bush he sees may be a goddess in disguise.
  Farewell, dear husband, and sister, and father. If you retain any love
  for me, let not the axe wound me, nor the flocks bite and tear my
  branches. Since I cannot stoop to you, climb up hither and kiss me;
  and while my lips continue to feel, lift up my child that I may kiss
  him. I can speak no more, for already the bark advances up my neck,
  and will soon shoot over me. You need not close my eyes, the bark will
  close them without your aid." Then the lips ceased to move, and life
  was extinct: but the branches retained for some time longer the
  vital heat.

  Keats, in "Endymion," alludes to Dryope thus:

  "She took a lute from which there pulsing came
  A lively prelude, fashioning the way
  In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay
  More subtle-cadenced, more forest-wild
  Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;" etc.
