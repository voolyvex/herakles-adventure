PEGASUS AND THE CHIMAERA
  When Perseus cut off Medusa's head, the blood sinking into the earth
  produced the winged horse Pegasus. Minerva caught and tamed him and
  presented him to the Muses. The fountain Hippocrene, on the Muse's
  mountain Helicon, was opened by a kick from his hoof.
  The Chimaera was a fearful monster, breathing fire. The fore part of
  its body was a compound of the lion and the goat, and the hind part
  a dragon's. It made great havoc in Lycia, so that the king, Iobates,
  sought for some hero to destroy it. At that time there arrived at
  his court a gallant young warrior, whose name was Bellerophon. He
  brought letters from Proetus, the son-in-law of Iobates,
  recommending Bellerophon in the warmest terms as an unconquerable
  hero, but added at the close a request to his father-in-law to put him
  to death. The reason was that Proetus was jealous of him, suspecting
  that his wife Antea looked with too much admiration on the young
  warrior. From this instance of Bellerophon being unconsciously the
  bearer of his own death warrant, the expression "Bellerophontic
  letters" arose, to describe any species of communication which a
  person is made the bearer of, containing matter prejudicial to
  himself.
  Iobates, on perusing the letters, was puzzled what to do, not
  willing to violate the claims of hospitality, yet wishing to oblige
  his son-in-law. A lucky thought occurred to him, to send Bellerophon
  to combat with the Chimaera. Bellerophon accepted the proposal, but
  before proceeding to the combat consulted the soothsayer Polyidus, who
  advised him to procure if possible the horse Pegasus for the conflict.
  For this purpose he directed him to pass the night in the temple of
  Minerva. He did so, and as he slept Minerva came to him and gave him a
  golden bridle. When he awoke the bridle remained in his hand.
  Minerva also showed him Pegasus drinking at the well of Pirene, and at
  sight of the bridle the winged steed came willingly and suffered
  himself to be taken. Bellerophon mounted him, rose with him into the
  air, soon found the Chimaera, and gained an easy victory over the
  monster.
  After the conquest of the Chimaera Bellerophon was exposed to
  further trials and labours by his unfriendly host, but by the aid of
  Pegasus he triumphed in them all, till at length Iobates, seeing
  that the hero was a special favourite of the gods, gave him his
  daughter in marriage and made him his successor on the throne. At last
  Bellerophon by his pride and presumption drew upon himself the anger
  of the gods; it is said he even attempted to fly up into heaven on his
  winged steed, but Jupiter sent a gadfly which stung Pegasus and made
  him throw his rider, who became lame and blind in consequence. After
  this Bellerophon wandered lonely through the Aleian field, avoiding
  the paths of men, and died miserably.

  Milton alludes to Bellerophon in the beginning of the seventh book
  of "Paradise Lost":

  "Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name
  If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine
  Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,
  Above the flight of Pegasean wing.
  Upled by thee,
  Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,
  An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air
  (Thy tempering); with like safety guided down
  Return me to my native element;
  Lest, from this flying steed unreined (as once
  Bellerophon, though from a lower clime),
  Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,
  Erroneous there to wander and forlorn."

  Young, in his "Night Thoughts," speaking of the sceptic, says:

  "He whose blind thought futurity denies,
  Unconscious bears, Bellerophon, like thee
  His own indictment; he condemns himself.
  Who reads his bosom reads immortal life,
  Or nature there, imposing on her sons,
  Has written fables; man was made a lie."
  Vol. II., p. 12.

  Pegasus, being the horse of the Muses, has always been at the
  service of the poets. Schiller tells a pretty story of his having been
  sold by a needy poet and put to the cart and the plough. He was not
  fit for such service, and his clownish master could make nothing of
  him. But a youth stepped forth and asked leave to try him. As soon
  as he was seated on his back the horse, which had appeared at first
  vicious, and afterwards spirit-broken, rose kingly, a spirit, a god,
  unfolded the splendour of his wings, and soared towards heaven. Our
  own poet Longfellow also records adventure of this famous steed in his
  "Pegasus in Pound."

  Shakespeare alludes to Pegasus in "Henry IV.," where Vernon
  describes Prince Henry:

  "I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,
  His cuishes on this thighs, gallantly armed,
  Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury,
  And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
  As if an angel dropped down from the clouds,
  To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus,
  And witch the world with noble horsemanship."
