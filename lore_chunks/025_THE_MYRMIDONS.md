THE MYRMIDONS
  The Myrmidons were the solders of Achilles, in the Trojan war.
  From them all zealous and unscrupulous followers of a political
  chief are called by that name, down to this day. But the origin of the
  Myrmidons would not give one the idea of a fierce and bloody race, but
  rather of a laborious and peaceful one.
  Cephalus, king of Athens, arrived in the island of AEgina to seek
  assistance of his old friend and ally AEacus, the king, in his war
  with Minos, king of Crete. Cephalus was most kindly received, and
  the desired assistance readily promised. "I have people enough,"
  said AEacus, "to protect myself and spare you such a force as you
  need." "I rejoice to see it," replied Cephalus, "and my wonder has
  been raised, I confess, to find such a host of youths as I see
  around me, all apparently of about the same age. Yet there are many
  individuals whom I previously knew, that I look for now in vain.
  What has become of them?" AEacus groaned, and replied with a voice
  of sadness, "I have been intending to tell you, and will now do so,
  without more delay, that you may see how from the saddest beginning
  a happy result sometimes flows. Those whom you formerly knew are now
  dust and ashes! A plague sent by angry Juno devastated the land. She
  hated it because it bore the name of one of her husband's female
  favourites. While the disease appeared to spring from natural causes
  we resisted it as we best might, by natural remedies; but it soon
  appeared that the pestilence was too powerful for our efforts, and
  we yielded. At the beginning the sky seemed to settle down upon the
  earth, and thick clouds shut in the heated air. For four months
  together a deadly south wind prevailed. The disorder affected the
  wells and springs; thousands of snakes crept over the land and shed
  their poison in the fountains. The force of the disease was first
  spent on the lower animals- dogs, cattle, sheep, and birds. The
  luckless ploughman wondered to see his oxen fall in the midst of their
  work, and lie helpless in the unfinished furrow. The wool fell from
  the bleating sheep, and their bodies pined away. The horse, once
  foremost in the race, contested the palm no more, but groaned at his
  stall and died an inglorious death. The wild boar forgot his rage, the
  stag his swiftness, the bears no longer attacked the herds. Everything
  languished; dead bodies lay in the roads, the fields, and the woods;
  the air was poisoned by them. I tell you what is hardly credible,
  but neither dogs nor birds would touch them, nor starving wolves.
  Their decay spread the infection. Next the disease attacked the
  country people, and then the dwellers in the city. At first the
  cheek was flushed, and the breath drawn with difficulty. The tongue
  grew rough and swelled, and the dry mouth stood open with its veins
  enlarged and gasped for the air. Men could not bear the heat of
  their clothes or their beds, but preferred to lie on the bare
  ground; and the ground did not cool them, but, on the contrary, they
  heated the spot where they lay. Nor could the physicians help, for the
  disease attacked them also, and the contact of the sick gave them
  infection, so that the most faithful were the first victims. At last
  all hope of relief vanished, and men learned to look upon death as the
  only deliverer from disease. Then they gave way to every
  inclination, and cared not to ask what was expedient, for nothing
  was expedient. All restraint laid aside, they crowded around the wells
  and fountains and drank till they died, without quenching thirst. Many
  had not strength to get away from the water, but died in the midst
  of the stream, and others would drink of it notwithstanding. Such
  was their weariness of their sick beds that some would creep forth,
  and if not strong enough to stand, would die on the ground. They
  seemed to hate their friends, and got away from their homes, as if,
  not knowing the cause of their sickness, they charged it on the
  place of their abode. Some were seen tottering along the road, as long
  as they could stand, while others sank on the earth, and turned
  their dying eyes around to take a last look, then closed them in
  death.
  "What heart had I left me, during all this, or what ought I to
  have had, except to hate life and wish to be with my dead subjects? On
  all sides lay my people strewn like over-ripened apples beneath the
  tree, or acorns under the storm-shaken oak. You see yonder a temple on
  the height. It is sacred to Jupiter. O how many offered prayers there,
  husbands for wives, fathers for sons, and died in the very act of
  supplication! How often, while the priest made ready for sacrifice,
  the victim fell, struck down by disease without waiting for the
  blow. At length all reverence for sacred things was lost. Bodies
  were thrown: out unburied, wood was wanting for funeral piles, men
  fought with one another for the possession of them. Finally there were
  none left to mourn; sons and husbands, old men and youths, Perished
  alike unlamented.
  "Standing before the altar I raised my eyes to heaven. 'O
  Jupiter,' I said, 'if thou art indeed my father, and art not ashamed
  of thy offspring, give me back my people, or take me also away!' At
  these words a clap of thunder was heard. 'I accept the omen,' I cried;
  'O may it be a sign of a favourable disposition towards me!' By chance
  there grew by the place where I stood an oak with wide-spreading
  branches, sacred to Jupiter. I observed a troop of ants busy with
  their labour, carrying minute grains in their mouths and following one
  another in a line up the trunk of the tree. Observing their numbers
  with admiration, I said, 'Give me, O father, citizens as numerous as
  these, and replenish my empty city.' The tree shook and gave a
  rustling sound with its branches, though no wind agitated them. I
  trembled in every limb, yet I kissed the earth and the tree. I would
  not confess to myself that I hoped, yet I did hope. Night came on
  and sleep took possession of my frame oppressed with cares. The tree
  stood before me in my dreams, with its numerous branches all covered
  with living, moving creatures. It seemed to shake its limbs and
  throw down over the ground a multitude of those industrious
  grain-gathering animals, which appeared to gain in size, and grow
  larger and larger, and by and by to stand erect, lay aside their
  superfluous legs and their black colour, and finally to assume the
  human form. Then I awoke, and my first impulse was to chide the gods
  who had robbed me of a sweet vision and given me no reality in its
  place. Being still in the temple, my attention was caught by the sound
  of many voices without; a sound of late unusual to my ears. While I
  began to think I was yet dreaming, Telamon, my son, throwing open
  the temple gates, exclaimed: 'Father, approach, and behold things
  surpassing even your hopes!' I went forth; I saw a multitude of men
  such as I had seen in my dream, and they were passing in procession in
  the same manner. While I gazed with wonder and delight they
  approached, and kneeling hailed me as their king. I paid my vows to
  Jove, and proceeded to allot the vacant city to the new-born race, and
  to parcel out the fields among them. I called them Myrmidons, from the
  ant (myrmex) from which they sprang. You have seen these persons;
  their dispositions resemble those which they had in their former
  shape. They are a diligent and industrious race, eager to gain, and
  tenacious of their gains. Among them you may recruit your forces. They
  will follow you to the war, young in years and bold in heart."
  This description of the plague is coped by Ovid from the account
  which Thucydides, the Greek historian, gives of the plague of
  Athens. The historian drew from life, and all the poets and writers of
  fiction since his day, when they have had occasion to describe a
  similar scene, have borrowed their details from him.
