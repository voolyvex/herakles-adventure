DIDO
  Carthage, where the exiles had now arrived, was a spot on the
  coast of Africa opposite Sicily, where at that time a Tyrian colony
  under Dido, their queen, were laying the foundations of a state
  destined in later ages to be the rival of Rome itself. Dido was the
  daughter of Belus, king of Tyre, and sister of Pygmalion, who
  succeeded his father on the throne. Her husband was Sichaeus, a man of
  immense wealth, but Pygmalion, who coveted his treasures, caused him
  to be put to death. Dido, with a numerous body of friends and
  followers, both men and women, succeeded in effecting their escape
  from Tyre, in several vessels, carrying with them the treasures of
  Sichaeus. On arriving at the spot which they selected as the seat of
  their future home, they asked of the natives only so much land as they
  could enclose with a bull's hide. When this was readily granted, she
  caused the hide to be cut into strips, and with them enclosed a spot
  on which she built a citadel, and called it Byrsa (a hide). Around
  this fort the city of Carthage rose, and soon became a powerful and
  flourishing place.
  Such was the state of affairs when AEneas with his Trojans arrived
  there. Dido received the illustrious exiles with friendliness and
  hospitality. "Not unacquainted with distress," she said, "I have
  learned to succour the unfortunate."* The queen's hospitality
  displayed itself in festivities at which games of strength and skill
  were exhibited. The strangers contended for the palm with her own
  subjects, on equal terms, the queen declaring that whether the
  victor were "Trojan or Tyrian should make no difference to her."*(2)
  At the feast which followed the games, AEneas gave at her request a
  recital of the closing events of the Trojan history and his own
  adventures after the fall of the city. Dido was charmed with his
  discourse and filled with admiration of his exploits. She conceived an
  ardent passion for him, and he for his part seemed well content to
  accept the fortunate chance which appeared to offer him at once a
  happy termination of his wanderings, a home, a kingdom, and a bride.
  Months rolled away in the enjoyment of pleasant intercourse, and it
  seemed as if Italy and the empire destined to be founded on its shores
  were alike forgotten. Seeing which, Jupiter despatched Mercury with
  a message to AEneas recalling him to a sense of his high destiny,
  and commanding him to resume his voyage.

  AEneas parted from Dido, though she tried every allurement and
  persuasion to detain him. The blow to her affection and her pride
  was too much for her to endure, and when she found that he was gone,
  she mounted a funeral pile which she had caused to be erected, and
  having stabbed herself was consumed with the pile. The flames rising
  over the city were seen by the departing Trojans, and, though the
  cause was unknown, gave to AEneas some intimation of the fatal event.
