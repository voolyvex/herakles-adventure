SYBARIS AND CROTONA
  Sybaris, a neighbouring city to Crotona, was as celebrated for
  luxury and effeminacy as Crotona for the reverse. The name has
  become proverbial. J. R. Lowell uses it in this sense in his
  charming little poem "To the Dandelion":

  "Not in mid June the golden-cuirassed bee
  Feels a more summer-like, warm ravishment
  In the white lily's breezy tent
  (His conquered Sybaris) than I when first
  From the dark green thy yellow circles burst."

  A war arose between the two cities, and Sybaris was conquered and
  destroyed. Milo, the celebrated athlete, led the army of Crotona. Many
  stories are told of Milo's vast strength, such as his carrying a
  heifer of four years old upon his shoulders and afterwards eating
  the whole of it in a single day. The mode of his death is thus
  related: As he was passing through a forest he saw the trunk of a tree
  which had been partially split open by wood-cutters, and attempted
  to rend it further; but the wood closed upon his hands and held him
  fast, in which state he was attacked and devoured by wolves.

  Byron, in his "Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte," alludes to the story of
  Milo:

  "He who of old would rend the oak
  Deemed not of the rebound;
  Chained by the trunk he vainly broke,
  Alone, how looked he round!"
