PYRAMUS AND THISBE
  Pyramus was the handsomest youth, and Thisbe the fairest maiden,
  in all Babylonia, where Semiramis reigned. Their parents occupied
  adjoining houses; and neighbourhood brought the young people together,
  and acquaintance ripened into love. They would gladly have married,
  but their parents forbade. One thing, however, they could not
  forbid- that love should glow with equal ardour in the bosoms of both.
  They conversed by signs and glances, and the fire burned more
  intensely for being covered up. In the wall that parted the two houses
  there was a crack, caused by some fault in the structure. No one had
  remarked it before, but the lovers discovered it. What will not love
  discover! It afforded a passage to the voice; and tender messages used
  to pass backward and forward through the gap. As they stood, Pyramus
  on this side, Thisbe on that, their breaths would mingle. "Cruel
  wall," they said, "why do you keep two lovers apart? But we will not
  be ungrateful. We owe you, we confess, the privilege of transmitting
  loving words to willing, ears." Such words they uttered on different
  sides of the wall; and when night came and they must say farewell,
  they pressed their lips upon the wall, she on her side, he on his,
  as they could come no nearer.
  Next morning, when Aurora had put out the stars, and the sun had
  melted the frost from the grass, they met at the accustomed spot.
  Then, after lamenting their hard fate, they agreed that next night,
  when all was still, they would slip away from the watchful eyes, leave
  their dwellings and walk out into the fields; and to insure a meeting,
  repair to a well-known edifice standing without the city's bounds,
  called the Tomb of Ninus, and that the one who came first should await
  the other at the foot of a certain tree. It was a white mulberry tree,
  and stood near a cool spring. All was agreed on, and they waited
  impatiently for the sun to go down beneath the waters and night to
  rise up from them. Then cautiously Thisbe stole forth, unobserved by
  the family, her head covered with a veil, made her way to the monument
  and sat down under the tree. As she sat alone in the dim light of
  the evening she descried a lioness, her jaws reeking with recent
  slaughter, approaching the fountain to slake her thirst. Thisbe fled
  at the sight, and sought refuge in the hollow of a rock. As she fled
  she dropped her veil. The lioness after drinking at the spring
  turned to retreat to the woods, and seeing the veil on the ground,
  tossed and rent it with her bloody mouth.
  Pyramus, having been delayed, now approached the place of meeting.
  He saw in the sand the footsteps of the lion, and the colour fled from
  his cheeks at the sight. Presently he found the veil all rent and
  bloody. "O hapless girl," said he, "I have been the cause of thy
  death! Thou, more worthy of life than I, hast fallen the first victim.
  I will follow. I am the guilty cause, in tempting thee forth to a
  place of such peril, and not being myself on the spot to guard thee.
  Come forth, ye lions, from the rocks, and tear this guilty body with
  your teeth." He took up the veil, carried it with him to the appointed
  tree, and covered it with kisses and with tears. "My blood also
  shall stain your texture," said he, and drawing his sword plunged it
  into his heart. The blood spurted from the wound, and tinged the white
  mulberries of the tree all red; and sinking into the earth reached the
  roots, so that the red colour mounted through the trunk to the fruit.
  By this time Thisbe, still trembling with fear, yet wishing not to
  disappoint her lover, stepped cautiously forth, looking anxiously
  for the youth, eager to tell him the danger she had escaped. When
  she came to the spot and saw the changed colour of the mulberries
  she doubted whether it was the same place. While she hesitated she saw
  the form of one struggling in the agonies of death. She started
  back, a shudder ran through her frame as a ripple on the face of the
  still water when a sudden breeze sweeps over it. But as soon as she
  recognized her lover, she screamed and beat her breast, embracing
  the lifeless body, pouring tears into its wounds, and imprinting
  kisses on the cold lips. "O Pyramus," she cried, "what has done
  this? Answer me, Pyramus; it is your own Thisbe that speaks. Hear
  me, dearest, and lift that drooping head!" At the name of Thisbe
  Pyramus opened his eyes, then closed them again. She saw her veil
  stained blood and the scabbard empty of its sword. "Thy own hand has
  slain thee, and for my sake," she said. "I too can be brave for
  once, and my love is as strong as thine. I will follow thee in
  death, for I have been the cause; and death which alone could part
  us shall not prevent my joining thee. And ye, unhappy parents of us
  both, deny us not our united request. As love and death have joined
  us, let one tomb contain us. And thou, tree, retain the marks of
  slaughter. Let thy berries still serve for memorials of our blood." So
  saying she plunged the sword into her breast. Her parents ratified her
  wish, the gods also ratified it. The two bodies were buried in one
  sepulchre, and the tree ever after brought forth purple berries, as it
  does to this day.

  Moore, in the "Sylph's Ball," speaking of Davy's Safety Lamp, is
  reminded of the wall that separated Thisbe and her lover:

  "O for that Lamp's metallic gauze,
  That curtain of protecting wire,
  Which Davy delicately draws
  Around illicit, dangerous fire!

  The wall he sets 'twixt Flame and Air,
  (Like that which barred young Thisbe's bliss,)
  Through whose small holes this dangerous pair
  May see each other, but not kiss."

  In Mickle's translation of the "Lusiad" occurs the following
  allusion to the story of Pyramus and Thisbe, and the metamorphosis
  of the mulberries. The poet is describing the Island of Love:

  "...here each gift of Pomona's hand bestows
  In cultured garden, free uncultured flows,
  The flavour sweeter and the hue more fair
  Than e'er was fostered by the hand of care.
  The cherry here in shining crimson glows,
  And stained with lovers' blood, in pendent rows,
  The mulberries o'erload the bending boughs."

  If any of our young readers can be so hard-hearted as to enjoy a
  laugh at the expense of poor Pyramus and Thisbe, they may find an
  opportunity by turning to Shakespeare's play of the "Midsummer Night's
  Dream," where it is most amusingly burlesqued.
