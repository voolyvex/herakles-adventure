CAMILLA
  Camilla, the favourite of Diana, a huntress and warrior, after the
  fashion of the Amazons, came with her band of mounted followers,
  including a select number of her own sex, and ranged herself on the
  side of Turnus. This maiden had never accustomed her fingers to the
  distaff or the loom, but had learned to endure the toils of war, and
  in speed to outstrip the wind. It seemed as if she might run over
  the standing corn without crushing it, or over the surface of the
  water without dipping her feet. Camilla's history had been singular
  from the beginning. Her father, Metabus, driven from his city by civil
  discord, carried with him in his flight his infant daughter. As he
  fled through the woods, his enemies in hot pursuit, he reached the
  bank of the river Amazenus, which, swelled by rain, seemed to debar
  a passage. He paused for a moment, then decided what to do. He tied
  the infant to his lance with wrappers of bark, and poising the
  weapon in his upraised hand, thus addressed Diana: "Goddess of the
  woods! I consecrate this maid to you"; then hurled the weapon with its
  burden to the opposite bank. The spear flew across the roaring
  water. His pursuers were already upon him, but he plunged into the
  river and swam across, and found the spear, with the infant safe on
  the other side. Thenceforth he lived among the shepherds, and
  brought up his daughter in woodland arts. While a child she was taught
  to use the bow and throw the javelin. With her sling she could bring
  down the crane or the wild swan. Her dress was a tiger's skin. Many
  mothers sought her for a daughter-in-law, but she continued faithful
  to Diana and repelled the thought of marriage.
