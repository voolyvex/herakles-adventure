LEUCOTHEA AND PALAEMON
  Ino, the daughter of Cadmus and wife of Athamas, flying from her
  frantic husband with her little son Melicertes in her arms, sprang
  from a cliff into the sea. The gods, out of compassion, make her a
  goddess of the sea, under the name of Leucothea, and him a god,
  under that of Palaemon. Both were held powerful to save from shipwreck
  and were invoked by sailors. Palaemon was usually represented riding
  on a dolphin. The Isthmian games were celebrated in his honour. He was
  called Portunus by the Romans, and believed to have jurisdiction of
  the ports and shores.

  Milton alludes to all these deities in the song at the conclusion of
  "Comus":

  "Sabrina fair...
  Listen and appear to us,
  In name of great Oceanus;
  By the earth-shaking Neptune's mace,
  And Tethys' grave, majestic pace;
  By hoary Nereus' wrinkled look,
  And the Carpathian wizard's hook,*

  By scaly Triton's winding shell,
  And old soothsaying Glaucus' spell,
  By Leucothea's lovely hands,
  And her son who rules the strands;
  By Thetis' tinsel-slippered feet,
  And the songs of Sirens sweet;" etc.

  * Proteus.

  Armstrong, the poet of the "Art of Preserving Health," under the
  inspiration of Hygeia, the goddess of health, thus celebrates the
  Naiads. Paeon is a name both of Apollo and AEsculapius.

  "Come ye Naiads! to the fountains lead!
  Propitious maids! the task remains to sing
  Your gifts (so Paeon, so the powers of Health
  Command), to praise your crystal element.
  O comfortable streams! with eager lips
  And trembling hands the languid thirsty quaff
  New life in you; fresh vigour fills their veins.
  No warmer cups the rural ages knew,
  None warmer sought the sires of humankind;
  Happy in temperate peace their equal days
  Felt not the alternate fits of feverish mirth
  And sick dejection; still serene and pleased,
  Blessed with divine immunity from ills,
  Long centuries they lived; their only fate
  Was ripe old age, and rather sleep than death."
