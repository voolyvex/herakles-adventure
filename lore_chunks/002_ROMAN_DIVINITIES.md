ROMAN DIVINITIES
  The preceding are Grecian divinities, though received also by the
  Romans. Those which follow are peculiar to Roman mythology:
  Saturn was an ancient Italian deity. It was attempted to identify
  him with the Grecian god Cronos, and fabled that after his
  dethronement by Jupiter he fled to Italy, where he reigned during what
  was called the Golden Age. In memory of his beneficent dominion, the
  feast of Saturnalia was held every year in the winter season. Then all
  public business was suspended, declarations of war and criminal
  executions were postponed, friends made presents to one another, and
  the slaves were indulged with great liberties. A feast was given
  them at which they sat at table, while their masters served them, to
  show the natural equality of men, and that all things belonged equally
  to all, in the reign of Saturn.
  Faunus,* the grandson of Saturn, was worshipped as the god of fields
  and shepherds, and also as a prophetic god. His name in the plural,
  Fauns, expressed a class of gamesome deities, like the Satyrs of the
  Greeks.

  * There was also a goddess called Fauna, or Bona Dea.

  Quirinus was a war god, said to be no other than Romulus, the
  founder of Rome, exalted after his death to a place among the gods.
  Bellona, a war goddess.
  Terminus, the god of landmarks. His statue was a rude stone or post,
  set in the ground to mark the boundaries of fields.
  Pales, the goddess presiding over cattle and pastures.
  Pomona presided over fruit trees.
  Flora, the goddess of flowers.
  Lucina, the goddess of childbirth.
  Vesta (the Hestia of the Greeks) was a deity presiding over the
  public and private hearth. A sacred fire, tended by six virgin
  priestesses called Vestals, flamed in her temple. As the safety of the
  city was held to be connected with its conservation, the neglect of
  the virgins, if they let it go out, was severely punished, and the
  fire was rekindled from the rays of the sun.
  Liber is the Latin name of Bacchus; and Mulciber of Vulcan.
  Janus was the porter of heaven. He opens the year, the first month
  being named after him. He is the guardian deity of gates, on which
  account he is commonly represented with two heads, because every
  door looks two ways. His temples at Rome were numerous. In war time
  the gates of the principal one were always open. In peace they were
  closed; but they were shut only once between the reign of Numa and
  that of Augustus.
  The Penates were the gods who were supposed to attend to the welfare
  and prosperity of the family. Their name is derived from Penus, the
  pantry, which was sacred to them. Every master of a family was the
  priest of the Penates of his own house.
  The Lares, or Lars, were also household gods, but differed from
  the Penates in being regarded as the deified spirits of mortals. The
  family Lars were held to be the souls of the ancestors, who watched
  over and protected their descendants. The words Lemur and Larva more
  nearly correspond to our word Ghost.
  The Romans believed that every man had his Genius, and every woman
  her Juno: that is, a spirit who had given them being, and was regarded
  as their protector through life. On their birthdays men made offerings
  to their Genius, women to their Juno.
  A modern poet thus alludes to some of the Roman gods:

  "Pomona loves the orchard,
  And Liber loves the vine,
  And Pales loves the straw-built shed;
  Warm with the breath of kine;
  And Venus loves the whisper
  Of plighted youth and maid,
  In April's ivory moonlight,
  Beneath the chestnut shade."
  Macaulay, "Prophecy of Capys."

  N.B.- It is to be observed that in proper names the final e and es
  are to be sounded. Thus Cybele and Penates are words of three
  syllables. But Proserpine and Thebes are exceptions and to be
  pronounced as English words.
