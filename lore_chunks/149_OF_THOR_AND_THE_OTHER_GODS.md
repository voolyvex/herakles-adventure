OF THOR AND THE OTHER GODS
  Thor, the thunderer, Odin's eldest son, is the strongest of gods and
  men, and possesses three very precious things. The first is a
  hammer, which both the Frost and the Mountain giants know to their
  cost, when they see it hurled against them in the air, for it has
  split many a skull of their fathers and kindred. When thrown, it
  returns to his hand of its own accord. The second rare thing he
  possesses is called the belt of strength. When he girds it about him
  his divine might is doubled. The third, also very precious, is his
  iron gloves, which he puts on whenever he would use his mallet
  efficiently. From Thor's name is derived our word Thursday.
  Frey is one of the most celebrated of the gods. He presides over
  rain and sunshine and all the fruits of the earth. His sister Freya is
  the most propitious of the goddesses. She loves music, spring, and
  flowers, and is particularly fond of the Elves (fairies). She is
  very fond of love ditties, and all lovers would do well to invoke her.
  Bragi is the god of poetry, and his song records the deeds of
  warriors. His wife, Iduna, keeps in a box the apples which the gods,
  when they feel old age approaching, have only to taste of to become
  young again.
  Heimdall is the watchman of the gods, and is therefore placed on the
  borders of heaven to prevent the giants from forcing their way over
  the bridge Bifrost (the rainbow). He requires less sleep than a
  bird, and sees by night as well as by day a hundred miles around
  him. So acute is his ear that no sound escapes him, for he can even
  hear the grass grow and the wool on a sheep's back.
