GLAUCUS AND SCYLLA
  Glaucus was a fisherman. One day he had drawn his nets to land,
  and had taken a great many fishes of various kinds. So he emptied
  his net, and. proceeded to sort the fishes on the grass. The place
  where he stood was a beautiful island in the river, a solitary spot,
  uninhabited, and not used for pasturage of cattle, not ever visited by
  any but himself. On a sudden, the fishes, which had been laid on the
  grass, began to revive and move their fins as if they were in the
  water; and while he looked on astonished, they one and all moved off
  to the water, plunged in, and swam away. He did not know what to
  make of this, whether some god had done it or some secret power in the
  herbage. "What herb has such a power?" he exclaimed; and gathering
  some of it, he tasted it. Scarce had the juices of the plant reached
  his palate when he found himself agitated with a longing desire for
  the water. He could no longer restrain himself, but bidding farewell
  to earth, he plunged into the stream. The gods of the water received
  him graciously, and admitted him to the honour of their society.
  They obtained the consent of Oceanus and Tethys, the sovereigns of the
  sea, that all that was mortal in him should be washed away. A
  hundred rivers poured their waters over him. Then he lost all sense of
  his former nature and all consciousness. When he recovered, he found
  himself changed in form and mind. His hair was sea-green, and
  trailed behind him on the water; his shoulders grew broad, and what
  had been thighs and legs assumed the form of a fish's tail. The
  sea-gods complimented him on the change of his appearance, and he
  fancied himself rather a good-looking personage.
  One day Glaucus saw the beautiful maiden Scylla, the favourite of
  the water-nymphs, rambling on the shore, and when she had found a
  sheltered nook, laving her limbs in the clear water. He fell in love
  with her, and showing himself on the surface, spoke to her, saying
  such things as he thought most likely to win her to stay; for she
  turned to run immediately on the sight of him, and ran till she had
  gained a cliff overlooking the sea. Here she stopped and turned
  round to see whether it was a god or a sea animal, and observed with
  wonder his shape and colour. Glaucus partly emerging from the water,
  and supporting himself against a rock, said, "Maiden, I am no monster,
  nor a sea animal, but a god: and neither Proteus nor Triton ranks
  higher than I. Once I was a mortal, and followed the sea for a living;
  but now I belong wholly to it." Then he told the story of his
  metamorphosis, and how he had been promoted to his present dignity,
  and added, "But what avails all this if it fails to move your
  heart?" He was going on in this strain, but Scylla turned and hastened
  away.
  Glaucus was in despair, but it occurred to him to consult the
  enchantress Circe. Accordingly he repaired to her island- the same
  where afterwards Ulysses landed, as we shall see in one of our later
  stories. After mutual salutations, he said, "Goddess, I entreat your
  pity; you alone can relieve the pain I suffer. The power of herbs I
  know as well as any one, for it is to them I owe my change of form.
  I love Scylla. I am ashamed to tell you how I have sued and promised
  to her, and how scornfully she has treated me. I beseech you to use
  your incantations, or potent herbs, if they are more prevailing, not
  to cure me of my love,- for that I do not wish,- but to make her share
  it and yield me a like return." To which Circe replied, for she was
  not insensible to the attractions of the sea-green deity, "You had
  better pursue a willing object; you are worthy to be sought, instead
  of having to seek in vain. Be not diffident, know your own worth. I
  protest to you that even I, goddess though I be, and learned in the
  virtues of plants and spells, should not know how to refuse you. If
  she scorns you scorn her; meet one who is ready to meet you half
  way, and thus make a due return to both at once." To these words
  Glaucus replied, "Sooner shall trees grow at the bottom of the
  ocean, and sea-weed on the top of the mountains, than I will cease
  to love Scylla, and her alone."
  The goddess was indignant, but she could not punish him, neither did
  she wish to do so, for she liked him too well; so she turned all her
  wrath against her rival, poor Scylla. She took plants of poisonous
  powers and mixed them together, with incantations and charms. Then she
  passed through the crowd of gambolling beasts, the victims of her art,
  and proceeded to the coast of Sicily, where Scylla lived. There was
  a little bay on the shore to which Scylla used to resort, in the
  heat of the day, to breathe the air of the sea, and to bathe in its
  waters. Here the goddess poured her poisonous mixture, and muttered
  over it incantations of mighty power. Scylla came as usual and plunged
  into the water up to her waist. What was her horror to perceive a
  brood of serpents and barking monsters surrounding her! At first she
  could not imagine they were a part of herself, and tried to run from
  them, and to drive them away; but as she ran she carried them with
  her, and when she tried to touch her limbs, she found her hands
  touch only the yawning jaws of monsters. Scylla remained rooted to the
  spot. Her temper grew as ugly as her form, and she took pleasure in
  devouring hapless mariners who came within her grasp. Thus she
  destroyed six of the companions of Ulysses, and tried to wreck the
  ships of AEneas, till at last she was turned into a rock, and as
  such still continues to be a terror to mariners.

  Keats, in his "Endymion," has given a new version of the ending of
  "Glaucus and Scylla." Glaucus consents to Circe's blandishments,
  till he by chance is witness to her transactions with her beasts.
  Disgusted with her treachery and cruelty, he tries to escape from her,
  but is taken and brought back, when with reproaches she banishes
  him, sentencing him to pass a thousand years in decrepitude and
  pain. He returns to the sea, and there finds the body of Scylla,
  whom the goddess has not transformed but drowned. Glaucus learns
  that his destiny is that, if he passes his thousand years in
  collecting all the bodies of drowned lovers, a youth beloved of the
  gods will appear and help him. Endymion fulfils this prophecy, and
  aids in restoring Glaucus to youth, and Scylla and all the drowned
  lovers to life.
  The following is Glaucus's account of his feelings after his
  "sea-change":

  "I plunged for life or death. To interknit
  One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff
  Might seem a work of pain; so not enough
  Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,
  And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt
  Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;
  Forgetful utterly of self-intent,
  Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.
  Then like a new-fledged bird that first doth show
  His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,
  I tried in fear the pinions of my will.
  'Twas freedom! and at once I visited
  The ceaseless wonders of his ocean-bed,"
  etc.- Keats.
