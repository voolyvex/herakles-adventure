THESEUS
  THESEUS was the son of AEgeus, king of Athens, and of AEthra,
  daughter of the king of Troezen. He was brought up at Troezen, and
  when arrived at manhood was to proceed to Athens and present himself
  to his father. AEgeus on parting from AEthra, before the birth of
  his son, placed his sword and shoes under a large stone and directed
  her to send his son to him when he became strong enough to roll away
  the stone and take them from under it. When she thought the time had
  come, his mother led Theseus to the stone, and he removed it with ease
  and took the sword and shoes. As the roads were infested with robbers,
  his grandfather pressed him earnestly to take the shorter and safer
  way to his father's country- by sea; but the youth, feeling in himself
  the spirit and the soul of a hero, and eager to signalize himself like
  Hercules, with whose fame all Greece then rang, by destroying the
  evil-doers and monsters that oppressed the country, determined on
  the more perilous and adventurous journey by land.
  His first day's journey brought him to Epidaurus, where dwelt a
  man named Periphetes, a son of Vulcan. This ferocious savage always
  went armed with a club of iron, and all travellers stood in terror
  of his violence. When he saw Theseus approach he assailed him, but
  speedily fell beneath the blows of the young hero, who took possession
  of his club and bore it ever afterwards as a memorial of his first
  victory.
  Several similar contests with the petty tyrants and marauders of the
  country followed, in all of which Theseus was victorious. One of these
  evil-doers was called Procrustes, or the Stretcher. He had an iron
  bedstead, on which he used to tie all travellers who fell into his
  hands. If they were shorter than the bed, he stretched their limbs
  to make them fit it; if they were longer than the bed, he lopped off a
  portion. Theseus served him as he had served others.
  Having overcome all the perils of the road, Theseus at length
  reached Athens, where new dangers awaited him. Medea, the sorceress,
  who had fled from Corinth after her separation from Jason, had
  become the wife of AEgeus, the father of Theseus. Knowing by her
  arts who he was, and fearing the loss of her influence with her
  husband if Theseus should be acknowledged as his son, she filled the
  mind of AEgeus with suspicions of the young stranger, and induced
  him to present him a cup of poison; but at the moment when Theseus
  stepped forward to take it, the sight of the sword which he wore
  discovered to his father who he was, and prevented the fatal
  draught. Medea, detected in her arts, fled once more from deserved
  punishment, and arrived in Asia, where the country afterwards called
  Media, received its name from her. Theseus was acknowledged by his
  father, and declared his successor.
  The Athenians were at that time in deep affliction, on account of
  the tribute which they were forced to pay to Minos, king of Crete.
  This tribute consisted of seven youths and seven maidens, who were
  sent every year to be devoured by the Minotaur, a monster with a
  bull's body and a human head. It was exceedingly strong and fierce,
  and was kept in a labyrinth constructed by Daedalus, so artfully
  contrived that whoever was enclosed in it could by no means find his
  way out unassisted. Here the Minotaur roamed, and was fed with human
  victims.
  Theseus resolved to deliver his countrymen from this calamity, or to
  die in the attempt. Accordingly, when the time of sending off the
  tribute came, and the youths and maidens were, according to custom,
  drawn by lot to be sent, he offered himself as one of the victims,
  in spite of the entreaties of his father. The ship departed under
  black sails, as usual, which Theseus promised his father to change for
  white, in case of his returning victorious. When they arrived in
  Crete, the youths and maidens were exhibited before Minos; and
  Ariadne, the daughter of the king, being present, became deeply
  enamoured of Theseus, by whom her love was readily returned. She
  furnished him with a sword, with which to encounter the Minotaur,
  and with a clue of thread by which he might find his way out of the
  labyrinth. He was successful, slew the Minotaur, escaped from the
  labyrinth, and taking Ariadne as the companion of his way, with his
  rescued companions sailed for Athens. On their way they stopped at the
  island of Naxos, where Theseus abandoned Ariadne, leaving her asleep.*
  His excuse for this ungrateful treatment of his benefactress was
  that Minerva appeared to him in a dream and commanded him to do so.

  * One of the finest pieces of sculpture in Italy, the recumbent
  Ariadne of the Vatican, represents this incident. A copy is in the
  Athenaeum gallery, Boston.

  On approaching the coast of Attica, Theseus forgot the signal
  appointed by his father, and neglected to raise the white sails, and
  the old king, thinking his son had perished, put an end to his own
  life. Theseus thus became king of Athens.
  One of the most celebrated of the adventures of Theseus is his
  expedition against the Amazons. He assailed them before they had
  recovered from the attack of Hercules, and carried off their queen
  Antiope. The Amazons in their turn invaded the country of Athens and
  penetrated into the city itself; and the final battle in which Theseus
  overcame them was fought in the very midst of the city. This battle
  was one of the favourite subjects of the ancient sculptors, and is
  commemorated in several works of art that are still extant.
  The friendship between Theseus and Pirithous was of a most
  intimate nature, yet it originated in the midst of arms. Pirithous had
  made an irruption into the plain of Marathon, and carried off the
  herds of the king of Athens. Theseus went to repel the plunderers. The
  moment Pirithous beheld him, he was seized with admiration; he
  stretched out his hand as a token of peace, and cried, "Be judge
  thyself- what satisfaction dost thou require?" "Thy friendship,"
  replied the Athenian, and they swore inviolable fidelity. Their
  deeds corresponded to their professions, and they ever continued
  true brothers in arms. Each of them aspired to espouse a daughter of
  Jupiter. Theseus fixed his choice on Helen, then but a child,
  afterwards so celebrated as the cause of the Trojan war, and with
  the aid of his friend he carried her off. Pirithous aspired to the
  wife of the monarch of Erebus; and Theseus, though aware of the
  danger, accompanied the ambitious lover in his descent to the
  underworld. But Pluto seized and set them on an enchanted rock at
  his palace gate, where they remained till Hercules arrived and
  liberated Theseus, leaving Pirithous to his fate.
  After the death of Antiope, Theseus married Phaedra, daughter of
  Minos, king of Crete. Phaedra saw in Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, a
  youth endowed with all the graces and virtues of his father, and of an
  age corresponding to her own. She loved him, but he repulsed her
  advances, and her love was changed to hate. She used her influence
  over her infatuated husband to cause him to be jealous of his son, and
  he imprecated the vengeance of Neptune upon him. As Hippolytus was one
  day driving his chariot along the shore, a sea-monster raised
  himself above the waters, and frightened the horses so that they ran
  away and dashed the chariot to pieces. Hippolytus was killed, but by
  Diana's assistance AEsculapius restored him to life. Diana removed
  Hippolytus from the power of his deluded father and false
  stepmother, and placed him in Italy under the protection of the
  nymph Egeria.
  Theseus at length lost the favour of his people, and retired to
  the court of Lycomedes, king of Scyros, who at first received him
  kindly, but afterwards treacherously slew him. In a later age the
  Athenian general Cimon discovered the place where his remains were
  laid, and caused them to be removed to Athens, where they were
  deposited in a temple called the Theseum, erected in honour of the
  hero.
  The queen of the Amazons whom Theseus espoused is by some called
  Hippolyta. That is the name she bears in Shakespeare's "Midsummer
  Night's Dream,"- the subject of which is the festivities attending the
  nuptials of Theseus and Hippolyta.
  Mrs. Hemans has a poem on the ancient Greek tradition that the
  "Shade of Theseus" appeared strengthening his countrymen at the battle
  of Marathon.
  Theseus is a semi-historical personage. It is recorded of him that
  he united the several tribes by whom the territory of Attica was
  then possessed into one state, of which Athens was the capital. In
  commemoration of this important event, he instituted the festival of
  Panathenaea, in honour of Minerva, the patron deity of Athens. This
  festival differed from the other Grecian games chiefly in two
  particulars. It was peculiar to the Athenians, and its chief feature
  was a solemn procession in which the Peplus, or sacred robe of
  Minerva, was carried to the Parthenon, and suspended be, fore the
  statue of the goddess. The Peplus was covered with embroidery,
  worked by select virgins of the noblest families in Athens. The
  procession consisted of persons of all ages and both sexes. The old
  men carried olive branches in their hands, and the young men bore
  arms. The young women carried baskets on their heads, containing the
  sacred utensils, cakes, and all things necessary for the sacrifices.
  The procession formed the subject of the bas-reliefs which embellished
  the outside of the temple of the Parthenon. A considerable portion
  of these sculptures is now in the British Museum among those known
  as the "Elgin marbles."
