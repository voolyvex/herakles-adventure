CUPID AND PSYCHE
  A CERTAIN king and queen had three daughters. The charms of the
  two elder were more than common, but the beauty of the youngest was so
  wonderful that the poverty of language is unable to express its due
  praise. The fame of her beauty was so great that strangers from
  neighbouring countries came in crowds to enjoy the sight, and looked
  on her with amazement, paying her that homage which is due only to
  Venus herself. In fact Venus found her altars deserted, while men
  turned their devotion to this young virgin. As she passed along, the
  people sang her praises, and strewed her way with chaplets and
  flowers.
  This perversion of homage due only to the immortal powers to the
  exaltation of a mortal gave great offence to the real Venus. Shaking
  her ambrosial locks with indignation, she exclaimed, "Am I then to
  be eclipsed in my honours by a mortal girl? In vain then did that
  royal shepherd, whose judgment was approved by Jove himself, give me
  the palm of beauty over my illustrious rivals, Pallas and Juno. But
  she shall not so quietly usurp my honours. I will give her cause to
  repent of so unlawful a beauty."
  Thereupon she calls her winged son Cupid, mischievous enough in
  his own nature, and rouses and provokes him yet more by her
  complaints. She points out Psyche to him and says, "My dear son,
  punish that contumacious beauty; give thy mother a revenge as sweet as
  her injuries are great; infuse into the bosom of that haughty girl a
  passion for some low, mean, unworthy being, so that she may reap a
  mortification as great as her present exultation and triumph."
  Cupid prepared to obey the commands of his mother. There are two
  fountains in Venus's garden, one of sweet waters, the other of bitter.
  Cupid filled two amber vases, one from each fountain, and suspending
  them from the top of his quiver, hastened to the chamber of Psyche,
  whom he found asleep. He shed a few drops from the bitter fountain
  over her lips, though the sight of her almost moved him to pity;
  then touched her side with the point of his arrow. At the touch she
  awoke, and opened eyes upon Cupid (himself invisible), which so
  startled him that in his confusion he wounded himself with his own
  arrow. Heedless of his wound, his whole thought now was to repair
  the mischief he had done, and he poured the balmy drops of joy over
  all her silken ringlets.
  Psyche, henceforth frowned upon by Venus, derived no benefit from
  all her charms. True, all eyes were cast eagerly upon her, and every
  mouth spoke her praises; but neither king, royal youth, nor plebeian
  presented himself to demand her in marriage. Her two elder sisters
  of moderate charms had now long been married to two royal princes; but
  Psyche, in her lonely apartment, deplored her solitude, sick of that
  beauty which, while it procured abundance of flattery, had failed to
  awaken love.
  Her parents, afraid that they had unwittingly incurred the anger
  of the gods, consulted the oracle of Apollo, and received this answer:
  "The virgin is destined for the bride of no mortal lover. Her future
  husband awaits her on the top of the mountain. He is a monster whom
  neither gods nor men can resist."
  This dreadful decree of the oracle filled all the people with
  dismay, and her parents abandoned themselves to grief. But Psyche
  said, "Why, my dear parents, do you now lament me? You should rather
  have grieved when the people showered upon me undeserved honours,
  and with one voice called me a Venus. I now perceive that I am a
  victim to that name. I submit. Lead me to that rock to which my
  unhappy fate has destined me." Accordingly, all things being prepared,
  the royal maid took her place in the procession, which more
  resembled a funeral than a nuptial pomp, and with her parents, amid
  the lamentations of the people, ascended the mountain, on the summit
  of which they left her alone, and with sorrowful hearts returned home.
  While Psyche stood on the ridge of the mountain, panting with fear
  and with eyes full of tears, the gentle Zephyr raised her from the
  earth and bore her with an easy motion into a flowery dale. By degrees
  her mind became composed, and she laid herself down on the grassy bank
  to sleep. When she awoke refreshed with sleep, she looked round and
  beheld near by a pleasant grove of tall and stately trees. She entered
  it, and in the midst discovered a fountain, sending forth clear and
  crystal waters, and fast by, a magnificent palace whose august front
  impressed the spectator that it was not the work of mortal hands,
  but the happy retreat of some god. Drawn by admiration and wonder, she
  approached the building and ventured to enter. Every object she met
  filled her with pleasure and amazement. Golden pillars supported the
  vaulted roof, and the walls were enriched with carvings and
  paintings representing beasts of the chase and rural scenes, adapted
  to delight the eye of the beholder. Proceeding onward, she perceived
  that besides the apartments of state there were others filled with all
  manner of treasures, and beautiful and precious productions of
  nature and art.
  While her eyes were thus occupied, a voice addressed her, though she
  saw no one, uttering these words: "Sovereign lady, all that you see is
  yours. We whose voices you hear are your servants and shall obey all
  your commands with our utmost care and diligence. Retire, therefore,
  to your chamber and repose on your bed of down, and when you see fit
  repair to the bath. Supper awaits you in the adjoining alcove when
  it pleases you to take your seat there."
  Psyche gave ear to the admonitions of her vocal attendants, and
  after repose and the refreshment of the bath, seated herself in the
  alcove, where a table immediately presented itself, without any
  visible aid from waiters or servants, and covered with the greatest
  delicacies of food and the most nectareous wines. Her ears too were
  feasted with music from invisible performers; of whom one sang,
  another played on the lute, and all closed in the wonderful harmony of
  a full chorus.
  She had not yet seen her destined husband. He came only in the hours
  of darkness and fled before the dawn of morning, but his accents
  were full of love, and inspired a like passion in her. She often
  begged him to stay and let her behold him, but he would not consent.
  On the contrary he charged her to make no attempt to see him, for it
  was his pleasure, for the best of reasons, to keep concealed. "Why
  should you wish to behold me?" he said; "have you any doubt of my
  love? have you any wish ungratified? If you saw me, perhaps you
  would fear me, perhaps adore me, but all I ask of you is to love me. I
  would rather you would love me as an equal than adore me as a god."
  This reasoning somewhat quieted Psyche for a time, and while the
  novelty lasted she felt quite happy. But at length the thought of
  her parents, left in ignorance of her fate, and of her sisters,
  precluded from sharing with her the delights of her situation,
  preyed on her mind and made her begin to feel her palace as but a
  splendid prison, When her husband came one night, she told him her
  distress, and at last drew from him an unwilling consent that her
  sisters should be brought to see her.
  So, calling Zephyr, she acquainted him with her husband's
  commands, and he, promptly obedient, soon brought them across the
  mountain down to their sister's valley. They embraced her and she
  returned their caresses. "Come," said Psyche, "enter with me my
  house and refresh yourselves with whatever your sister has to
  offer." Then taking their hands she led them into her golden palace,
  and committed them to the care of her numerous train of attendant
  voices, to refresh them in her baths and at her table, and to show
  them all her treasures. The view of these celestial delights caused
  envy to enter their bosoms, at seeing their young sister possessed
  of such state and splendour so much exceeding their own.
  They asked her numberless questions, among others what sort of a
  person her husband was. Psyche replied that he was a beautiful
  youth, who generally spent the daytime in hunting upon the
  mountains. The sisters, not satisfied with this reply, soon made her
  confess that she had never seen him. Then they proceeded to fill her
  bosom with dark suspicions. "Call to mind," they said, "the Pythian
  oracle that declared you destined to marry a direful and tremendous
  monster. The inhabitants of this valley say that your husband is a
  terrible and monstrous serpent, who nourishes you for a while with
  dainties that he may by and by devour you. Take our advice. Provide
  yourself with a lamp and a sharp knife; put them in concealment that
  your husband may not discover them, and when he is sound asleep,
  slip out of bed, bring forth your lamp, and see for yourself whether
  what they say is true or not. If it is, hesitate not to cut off the
  monster's head, and thereby recover your liberty."
  Psyche resisted these persuasions as well as she could, but they did
  not fail to have their effect on her mind, and when her sisters were
  gone, their words and her own curiosity were too strong for her to
  resist. So she prepared her lamp and a sharp knife, and hid them out
  of sight of her husband. When he had fallen into his first sleep,
  she silently rose and uncovering her lamp beheld not a hideous
  monster, but the most beautiful and charming of the gods, with his
  golden ringlets wandering over his snowy neck and crimson cheek,
  with two dewy wings on his shoulders, whiter than snow, and with
  shining feathers like the tender blossoms of spring. As she leaned the
  lamp over to have a nearer view of his face a drop of burning oil fell
  on the shoulder of the god, startled with which he opened his eyes and
  fixed them full upon her; then, without saying one word, he spread his
  white wings and flew out of the window. Psyche, in vain endeavouring
  to follow him, fell from the window to the ground. Cupid, beholding
  her as she lay in the dust, stopped his flight for an instant and
  said, "O foolish Psyche, is it thus you repay my love? After having
  disobeyed my mother's commands and made you my wife, will you think me
  a monster and cut off my head? But go; return to your sisters, whose
  advice you seem to think preferable to mine. I inflict no other
  punishment on you than to leave you for ever. Love cannot dwell with
  suspicion." So saying, he fled away, leaving poor Psyche prostrate
  on the ground, filling the place with mournful lamentations.
  When she had recovered some degree of composure she looked around
  her, but the palace and gardens had vanished, and she found herself in
  the open field not far from the city where her sisters dwelt. She
  repaired thither and told them the whole story of her misfortunes,
  at which, pretending to grieve, those spiteful creatures inwardly
  rejoiced. "For now," said they, "he will perhaps choose one of us."
  With this idea, without saying a word of her intentions, each of
  them rose early the next morning and ascended the mountain, and having
  reached the top, called upon Zephyr to receive her and bear her to his
  lord; then leaping up, and not being sustained by Zephyr, fell down
  the precipice and was dashed to pieces.
  Psyche meanwhile wandered day and night, without food or repose,
  in search of her husband. Casting her eyes on a lofty mountain
  having on its brow a magnificent temple, she sighed and said to
  herself, "Perhaps my love, my lord, inhabits there," and directed
  her steps thither.
  She had no sooner entered than she saw heaps of corn, some in
  loose ears and some in sheaves, with mingled ears of barley. Scattered
  about, lay sickles and rakes, and all the instruments of harvest,
  without order, as if thrown carelessly out of the weary reapers' hands
  in the sultry hours of the day.
  This unseemly confusion the pious Psyche put an end to, by
  separating and sorting everything to its proper place and kind,
  believing that she ought to neglect none of the gods, but endeavour by
  her piety to engage them all in her behalf. The holy Ceres, whose
  temple it was, finding her so religiously employed, thus spoke to her:
  "O Psyche, truly worthy of our pity, though I cannot shield you from
  the frowns of Venus, yet I can teach you how best to allay her
  displeasure. Go, then, and voluntarily surrender yourself to your lady
  and sovereign, and try by modesty and submission to win her
  forgiveness, and perhaps her favour will restore you the husband you
  have lost."
  Psyche obeyed the commands of Ceres and took her way to the temple
  of Venus, endeavouring to fortify her mind and ruminating on what
  she should say and how best propitiate the angry goddess, feeling that
  the issue was doubtful and perhaps fatal.
  Venus received her with angry countenance. "Most undutiful and
  faithless of servants," said she, "do you at last remember that you
  really have a mistress? Or have you rather come to see your sick
  husband, yet laid up of the wound given him by his loving wife? You
  are so ill-favoured and disagreeable that the only way you can merit
  your lover must be by dint of industry and diligence. I will make
  trial of your housewifery." Then she ordered Psyche to be led to the
  storehouse of her temple, where was laid up a great quantity of wheat,
  barley, millet, vetches, beans, and lentils prepared for food for
  her pigeons, and said, "Take and separate all these grains, putting
  all of the same kind in a parcel by themselves, and see that you get
  it done before evening." Then Venus departed and left her to her task.
  But Psyche, in a perfect consternation at the enormous work, sat
  stupid and silent, without moving a finger to the inextricable heap.
  While she sat despairing, Cupid stirred up the little ant, a
  native of the fields, to take compassion on her. The leader of the
  ant-hill, followed by whole hosts of his six-legged subjects,
  approached the heap, and with the utmost diligence taking grain by
  grain, they separated the pile, sorting each kind to its parcel; and
  when it was all done, they vanished out of sight in a moment.
  Venus at the approach of twilight returned from the banquet of the
  gods. breathing odours and crowned with roses. Seeing the task done,
  she exclaimed, "This is no work of yours, wicked one, but his, whom to
  your own and his misfortune you have enticed." So saying, she threw
  her a piece of black bread for her supper and went away.
  Next morning Venus ordered Psyche to be called and said to her,
  "Behold yonder grove which stretches along the margin of the water.
  There you will find sheep feeding without a shepherd, with
  golden-shining fleeces on their backs. Go, fetch me a sample of that
  precious wool gathered from every one of their fleeces."
  Psyche obediently went to the riverside, prepared to do her best
  to execute the command. But the river god inspired the reeds with
  harmonious murmurs, which seemed to say, "O maiden, severely tried,
  tempt not the dangerous flood, nor venture among the formidable rams
  on the other side, for as long as they are under the influence of
  the rising sun, they burn with a cruel rage to destroy mortals with
  their sharp horns or rude teeth. But when the noontide sun has
  driven the cattle to the shade, and the serene spirit of the flood has
  lulled them to rest, you may then cross in safety, and you will find
  the woolly gold sticking to the bushes and the trunks of the trees."
  Thus the compassionate river god gave Psyche instructions how to
  accomplish her task, and by observing his directions she soon returned
  to Venus with her arms full of the golden fleece; but she received not
  the approbation of her implacable mistress, who said, "I know very
  well it is by none of your own doings that you have succeeded in
  this task, and I am not satisfied yet that you have any capacity to
  make yourself useful. But I have another task for you. Here, take this
  box and go your way to the infernal shades, and give this box to
  Proserpine and say, 'My mistress Venus desires you to send her a
  little of your beauty, for in tending her sick son she has lost some
  of her own.' Be not too long on your errand, for I must paint myself
  with it to appear at the circle of the gods and goddesses this
  evening."
  Psyche was now satisfied that her destruction was at hand, being
  obliged to go with her own feet directly down to Erebus. Wherefore, to
  make no delay of what was not to be avoided, she goes to the top of
  a high tower to precipitate herself headlong, thus to descend the
  shortest way to the shades below. But a voice from the tower said to
  her, "Why, poor unlucky girl, dost thou design to put an end to thy
  days in so dreadful a manner? And what cowardice makes thee sink under
  this last danger who hast been so miraculously supported in all thy
  former?" Then the voice told her how by a certain cave she might reach
  the realms of Pluto, and how to avoid all the dangers of the road,
  to pass by Cerberus, the three-headed dog, and prevail on Charon,
  the ferryman, to take her across the black river and bring her back
  again. But the voice added, "When Proserpine has given you the box
  filled with her beauty, of all things this is chiefly to be observed
  by you, that you never once open or look into the box nor allow your
  curiosity to pry into the treasure of the beauty of the goddesses."
  Psyche, encouraged by this advice, obeyed it in all things, and
  taking heed to her ways travelled safely to the kingdom of Pluto.
  She was admitted to the palace of Proserpine, and without accepting
  the delicate seat or delicious banquet that was offered her, but
  contented with coarse bread for her food, she delivered her message
  from Venus. Presently the box was returned to her, shut and filled
  with the precious commodity. Then she returned the way she came, and
  glad was she to come out once more into the light of day.
  But having got so far successfully through her dangerous task a
  longing desire seized her to examine the contents of the box,
  "What," said she, "shall I, the carrier of this divine beauty, not
  take the least bit to put on my cheeks to appear to more advantage
  in the eyes of my beloved husband!" So she carefully opened the box,
  but found nothing there of any beauty at all, but an infernal and
  truly Stygian sleep, which being thus set free from its prison, took
  possession of her, and she fell down in the midst of the road, a
  sleepy corpse without sense or motion.
  But Cupid, being now recovered from his wound, and not able longer
  to bear the absence of his beloved Psyche, slipping through the
  smallest crack of the window of his chamber which happened to be
  left open, flew to the spot where Psyche lay, and gathering up the
  sleep from her body closed it again in the box, and waked Psyche
  with a light touch of one of his arrows. "Again," said he, "hast
  thou almost perished by the same curiosity. But now perform exactly
  the task imposed on you by my mother, and I will take care of the
  rest.
  Then Cupid, as swift as lightning penetrating the heights of heaven,
  presented himself before Jupiter with his supplication. Jupiter lent a
  favouring ear, and pleaded the cause of the lovers so earnestly with
  Venus that he won her consent. On this he sent Mercury to bring Psyche
  up to the heavenly assembly, and when she arrived, handing her a cup
  of ambrosia, he said, "Drink this, Psyche, and be immortal; nor
  shall Cupid ever break away from the knot in which he is tied, but
  these nuptials shall be perpetual."
  Thus Psyche became at last united to Cupid, and in due time they had
  a daughter born to them whose name was Pleasure.
  The fable of Cupid and Psyche is usually considered allegorical. The
  Greek name for a butterfly is Psyche, and the same word means the
  soul. There is no illustration of the immortality of the soul so
  striking and beautiful as the butterfly, bursting on brilliant wings
  from the tomb in which it has lain, after a dull, grovelling,
  caterpillar existence, to flutter in the blaze of day and feed on
  the most fragrant and delicate productions of the spring. Psyche,
  then, is the human soul, which is purified by sufferings and
  misfortunes, and is thus prepared for the enjoyment of true and pure
  happiness.
  In works of art Psyche is represented as a maiden with the wings
  of a butterfly, along with Cupid, in the different situations
  described in the allegory.
  Milton alludes to the story of Cupid and Psyche in the conclusion of
  his "Comus":

  "Celestial Cupid, her famed son, advanced,
  Holds his dear Psyche sweet entranced,
  After her wandering labours long,
  Till free consent the gods among
  Make her his eternal bride;
  And from her fair unspotted side
  Two blissful twins are to be born,
  Youth and Joy; so Jove hath sworn."

  The allegory of the story of Cupid and Psyche is well presented in
  the beautiful lines of T. K. Harvey:

  "They wove bright fables in the days of old,
  When reason borrowed fancy's painted wings;
  When truth's clear river flowed o'er sands of gold,
  And told in song its high and mystic things!
  And such the sweet and solemn tale of her
  The pilgrim heart, to whom a dream was given,
  That led her through the world,- Love's worshipper,-
  To seek on earth for him whose home was heaven!

  "In the full city,- by the haunted fount,-
  Through the dim grotto's tracery of spars,-
  'Mid the pine temples, on the moonlit mount,
  Where silence sits to listen to the stars;
  In the deep glade where dwells the brooding dove,
  The painted valley, and the scented air,
  She heard far echoes of the voice of Love,
  And found his footsteps' traces everywhere.

  "But nevermore they met! since doubts and fears,
  Those phantom shapes that haunt and blight the earth,
  Had come 'twixt her, a child of sin and tears,
  And that bright spirit of immortal birth;
  Until her pining soul and weeping eyes
  Had learned to seek him only in the skies;
  Till wings unto the weary heart were given,
  And she became Love's angel bride in heaven!"

  The story of Cupid and Psyche first appears in the works of
  Apuleius, a writer of the second century of our era. It is therefore
  of much more recent date than most of the legends of the Age of Fable.
  It is this that Keats alludes to in his "Ode to Psyche":

  "O latest born and loveliest vision far
  Of all Olympus' faded hierarchy!
  Fairer than Phoebe's sapphire-regioned star
  Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky;
  Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,
  Nor altar heaped with flowers;
  Nor virgin choir to make delicious moan
  Upon the midnight hours;
  No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet,
  From chain-swung censer teeming;
  No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat
  Of pale-mouthed prophet dreaming."

  In Moore's "Summer Fete" a fancy ball is described, in which one
  of the characters personated is Psyche-

  "...not in dark disguise to-night
  Hath our young heroine veiled her light;-
  For see, she walks the earth, Love's own.
  His wedded bride, by holiest vow
  Pledged in Olympus, and made known
  To mortals by the type which now
  Hangs glittering on her snowy brow,
  That butterfly, mysterious trinket,
  Which means the soul, (though few would think it,)
  And sparkling thus on brow so white
  Tells us we've Psyche here to-night."
