ACHELOUS AND HERCULES
  THE river-god Achelous told the story of Erisichthon to Theseus
  and his companions, whom he was entertaining at his hospitable
  board, while they were delayed on their journey by the overflow of his
  waters. Having finished his story, he added, "But why should I tell of
  other persons' transformations when I myself am an instance of the
  possession of this power? Sometimes I become a serpent, and
  sometimes a bull, with horns on my head. Or I should say I once
  could do so; but now I have but one horn, having lost one." And here
  he groaned and was silent.
  Theseus asked him the cause of his grief, and how he lost his
  horn. To which question the river-god replied as follows: "Who likes
  to tell of his defeats? Yet I will not hesitate to relate mine,
  comforting myself with the thought of the greatness of my conqueror,
  for it was Hercules. Perhaps you have heard of the fame of Dejanira,
  the fairest of maidens, whom a host of suitors strove to win. Hercules
  and myself were of the number, and the rest yielded to us two. He
  urged in his behalf his descent from Jove and his labours by which
  he had exceeded the exactions of Juno, his stepmother. I, on the other
  hand, said to the father of the maiden, 'Behold me, the king of the
  waters that flow through your land. I am no stranger from a foreign
  shore, but belong to the country, a part of your realm. Let it not
  stand in my way that royal Juno owes me no enmity nor punishes me with
  heavy tasks. As for this man, who boasts himself the son of Jove, it
  is either a false pretence, or disgraceful to him if true, for it
  cannot be true except by his mother's shame.' As I said this
  Hercules scowled upon me, and with difficulty restrained his rage. 'My
  hand will answer better than my tongue,' said he. 'I yield to you
  the victory in words, but trust my cause to the strife of deeds.' With
  that he advanced towards me, and I was ashamed, after what I had said,
  to yield. I threw off my green vesture and presented myself for the
  struggle. He tried to throw me, now attacking my head, now my body. My
  bulk was my protection, and he assailed me in vain. For a time we
  stopped, then returned to the conflict. We each kept our position,
  determined not to yield, foot to foot, I bending over him, clenching
  his hand in mine, with my forehead almost touching his. Thrice
  Hercules tried to throw me off, and the fourth time he succeeded,
  brought me to the ground, and himself upon my back. I tell you the
  truth, it was as if a mountain had fallen on me. I struggled to get my
  arms at liberty, panting and reeking with perspiration. He gave me
  no chance to recover, but seized my throat. My knees were on the earth
  and my mouth in the dust.
  "Finding that I was no match for him in the warrior's art, I
  resorted to others and glided away in the form of a serpent. I
  curled my body in a coil and hissed at him with my forked tongue. He
  smiled scornfully at this, and said, 'It was the labour of my
  infancy to conquer snakes.' So saying he clasped my neck with his
  hands. I was almost choked, and struggled to get my neck out of his
  grasp. Vanquished in this form, I tried what alone remained to me
  and assumed the form of a bull. He grasped my neck with his arm, and
  dragging my head down to the ground, overthrew me on the sand. Nor was
  this enough. His ruthless hand rent my horn from my head. The Naiads
  took it, consecrated it, and filled it with fragrant flowers. Plenty
  adopted my horn and made it her own, and called it 'Cornucopia.'"

  The ancients were fond of finding a hidden meaning in their
  mythological tales. They explain this fight of Achelous with
  Hercules by saying Achelous was a river that in seasons of rain
  overflowed its banks. When the fable says that Achelous loved
  Dejanira, and sought a union with her, the meaning is that the river
  in its windings flowed through part of Dejanira's kingdom. It was said
  to take the form of a snake because of its winding, and of a bull
  because it made a brawling or roaring in its course. When the river
  swelled, it made itself another channel. Thus its head was horned.
  Hercules prevented the return of these periodical overflows by
  embankments and canals; and therefore he was said to have vanquished
  the river-god and cut off his horn. Finally, the lands formerly
  subject to overflow, but now redeemed, became very fertile, and this
  is meant by the horn of plenty.
  There is another account of the origin of the Cornucopia. Jupiter at
  his birth was committed by his mother Rhea to the care of the
  daughters of Melisseus, a Cretan king. They fed the infant deity
  with the milk of the goat Amalthea. Jupiter broke off one of the horns
  of the goat and gave it to his nurses, and endowed it with the
  wonderful power of becoming filled with whatever the possessor might
  wish.
  The name of Amalthea is also given by some writers to the mother
  of Bacchus. It is thus used by Milton, "Paradise Lost," Book IV.:

  "...That Nyseian isle,
  Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham,
  Whom Gentiles Ammon call, and Libyan Jove,
  Hid Amalthea and her florid son,
  Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye."
