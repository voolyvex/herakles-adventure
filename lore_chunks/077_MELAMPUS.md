MELAMPUS
  Melampus was the first mortal endowed with prophetic powers.
  Before his house there stood an oak tree containing a serpent's
  nest. The old serpents were killed by the servants, but Melampus
  took care of the young ones and fed them carefully. One day when he
  was asleep under the oak the serpents licked his ears with their
  tongues. On awaking he was astonished to find that he now understood
  the language of birds and creeping things. This knowledge enabled
  him to foretell future events, and he became a renowned soothsayer. At
  one time his enemies took him captive and kept him strictly
  imprisoned. Melampus in the silence of the night heard the woodworms
  in the timbers talking together, and found out by what they said
  that the timbers were nearly eaten through and the roof would soon
  fall in. He told his captors and demanded to be let out, warning
  them also. They took his warning, and thus escaped destruction, and
  regarded Melampus and held him in high honour.
