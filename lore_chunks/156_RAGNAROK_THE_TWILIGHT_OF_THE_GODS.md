RAGNAROK, THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS
  It was a firm belief of the northern nations that a time would
  come when all the visible creation, the gods of Valhalla and
  Niffleheim, the inhabitants of Jotunheim, Alfheim, and Midgard,
  together with their habitations, would be destroyed. The fearful day
  of destruction will not, however, be without its forerunners. First
  will come a triple winter, during which snow will fall from the four
  corners of the heavens, the frost be very severe, the wind piercing,
  the weather tempestuous, and the sun impart no gladness. Three such
  winters will pass away without being tempered by a single summer.
  Three other similar winters will then follow, during which war and
  discord will spread over the universe. The earth itself will be
  frightened and begin to tremble, the sea leave its basin, the
  heavens tear asunder, and men perish in great numbers, and the
  eagles of the air feast upon their still quivering bodies. The wolf
  Fenris will now break his bands, the Midgard serpent rise out of her
  bed in the sea, and Loki, released from his bonds, will join the
  enemies of the gods. Amidst the general devastation the sons of
  Muspelheim will rush forth under their leader Surtur, before and
  behind whom are flames and burning fire. Onward they ride over
  Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, which breaks under the horses' hoofs. But
  they, disregarding its fall, direct their course to the battlefield
  called Vigrid. Thither also repair the wolf Fenris, the Midgard
  serpent, Loki with all the followers of Hela, and the Frost giants.
  Heimdall now stands up and sounds the Giallar horn to assemble the
  gods and heroes for the contest. The gods advance, led on by Odin, who
  engages the wolf Fenris, but falls a victim to the monster, who is,
  however, slain by Vidar, Odin's son. Thor gains great renown by
  killing the Midgard serpent, but recoils and falls dead, suffocated
  with the venom which the dying monster vomits over him. Loki and
  Heimdall meet and fight till they are both slain. The gods and their
  enemies having fallen in battle, Surtur, who has killed Freyr, darts
  fire and flames over the world, and the whole universe is burned up.
  The sun becomes dim, the earth sinks into the ocean, the stars fall
  from heaven, and time is no more.
  After this Alfadur (the Almighty) will cause a new heaven and a
  new earth to arise out of the sea. The new earth filled with
  abundant supplies will spontaneously produce its fruits without labour
  or care. Wickedness and misery will no more be known, but the gods and
  men will live happily together.
