MINERVA
  MINERVA, the goddess of wisdom, was the daughter of Jupiter. She was
  said to have leaped forth from his brain, mature, and in complete
  armour. She presided over the useful and ornamental arts, both those
  of men- such as agriculture and navigation- and those of women,-
  spinning, weaving, and needlework. She was also a warlike divinity;
  but it was defensive war only that she patronized, and she had no
  sympathy with Mars's savage love of violence and bloodshed. Athens was
  her chosen seat, her own city, awarded to her as the prize of a
  contest with Neptune, who also aspired to it, The tale ran that in the
  reign of Cecrops, the first king of Athens, the two deities
  contended for the possession of the city. The gods decreed that it
  should be awarded to that one who produced the gift most useful to
  mortals. Neptune gave the horse; Minerva produced the olive. The
  gods gave judgment that the olive was the more useful of the two,
  and awarded the city to the goddess; and it was named after her,
  Athens, her name in Greek being Athene.
  There was another contest, in which a mortal dared to come in
  competition with Minerva. That mortal was Arachne, a maiden who had
  attained such skill in the arts of weaving and embroidery that the
  nymphs themselves would leave their groves and fountains to come and
  gaze upon her work. It was not only beautiful when it was done, but
  beautiful also in the doing. To watch her, as she took the wool in its
  rude state and formed it into rolls, or separated it with her
  fingers and carded it till it looked as light and soft as a cloud,
  or twirled the spindle with skilful touch, or wove the web, or,
  after it was woven, adorned it with her needle, one would have said
  that Minerva herself had taught her. But this she denied, and could
  not bear to be thought a pupil even of a goddess. "Let Minerva try her
  skill with mine," said she; "if beaten I will pay the penalty."
  Minerva heard this and was displeased. She assumed the form of an
  old woman and went and gave Arachne some friendly advice. "I have
  had much experience," said she, "and I hope you will not despise my
  counsel. Challenge your fellow-mortals as you will, but do not compete
  with a goddess. On the contrary, I advise you to ask her forgiveness
  for what you have said, and as she is merciful perhaps she will pardon
  you." Arachne stopped her spinning and looked at the old dame with
  anger in her countenance. "Keep your counsel," said she, "for your
  daughters or handmaids; for my part I know what I say, and I stand
  to it. I am not afraid of the goddess; let her try her skill, if she
  dare venture." "She comes," said Minerva; and dropping her disguise
  stood confessed. The nymphs bent low in homage, and all the bystanders
  paid reverence. Arachne alone was unterrified. She blushed, indeed;
  a sudden colour dyed her cheek, and then she grew pale. But she
  stood to her resolve, and with a foolish conceit of her own skill
  rushed on her fate. Minerva forbore no longer nor interposed any
  further advice. They proceed to the contest. Each takes her station
  and attaches the web to the beam. Then the slender shuttle is passed
  in and out among the threads. The reed with its fine teeth strikes the
  woof into its place and compacts the web. Both work with speed;
  their skilful hands move rapidly, and the excitement of the contest
  makes the labour light. Wool of Tyrian dye is contrasted with that
  of other colours, shaded off into one another so adroitly that the
  joining deceives the eye. Like the bow, whose long arch tinges the
  heavens, formed by sunbeams reflected from the shower,* in which,
  where the colours meet they seem as one, but a little distance from
  the point of contact are wholly different.

  * This correct description of the rainbow is literally translated
  from Ovid.

  Minerva wrought on her web the scene of her contest with Neptune.
  Twelve of the heavenly powers are represented, Jupiter, with august
  gravity, sitting in the midst. Neptune, the ruler of the sea, holds
  his trident, and appears to have just smitten the earth, from which
  a horse has leaped forth. Minerva depicted herself with helmed head,
  her AEgis covering her breast. Such was the central circle; and in the
  four corners were represented incidents illustrating the displeasure
  of the gods at such presumptuous mortals as had dared to contend
  with them. These were meant as warnings to her rival to give up the
  contest before it was too late.
  Arachne filled her web with subjects designedly chosen to exhibit
  the failings and errors of the gods. One scene represented Leda
  caressing the swan, under which form Jupiter had disguised himself;
  and another, Danae, in the brazen tower in which her father had
  imprisoned her, but where the god effected his entrance in the form of
  a golden shower. Still another depicted Europa deceived by Jupiter
  under the disguise of a bull. Encouraged by the tameness of the animal
  Europa ventured to mount his back, whereupon Jupiter advanced into the
  sea and swam with her to Crete, You would have thought it was a real
  bull, so naturally was it wrought, and so natural the water in which
  it swam. She seemed to look with longing eyes back upon the shore
  she was leaving, and to call to her companions for help. She
  appeared to shudder with terror at the sight of the heaving waves, and
  to draw back her feel, from the water.
  Arachne filled her canvas with similar subjects, wonderfully well
  done, but strongly marking her presumption and impiety. Minerva
  could not forbear to admire, yet felt indignant at the insult. She
  struck the web with her shuttle and rent it in pieces; she then
  touched the forehead of Arachne and made her feel her guilt and shame.
  She could not endure it and went and hanged herself. Minerva pitied
  her as she saw her suspended by a rope. "Live," she said, "guilty
  woman! and that you may preserve the memory of this lesson, continue
  to hang, both you and your descendants, to all future times." She
  sprinkled her with the juices of aconite, and immediately her hair
  came off, and her nose and ears likewise. Her form shrank up, and
  her head grew smaller yet; her fingers cleaved to her side and
  served for legs. All the rest of her is body, out of which she spins
  her thread, often hanging suspended by it, in the same attitude as
  when Minerva touched her and transformed her into a spider.

  Spenser tells the story of Arachne in his "Muiopotmos," adhering
  very closely to his master Ovid, but improving upon him in the
  conclusion of the story. The two stanzas which follow tell what was
  done after the goddess had depicted her creation of the olive tree:

  "Amongst these leaves she made a Butterfly,
  With excellent device and wondrous slight,
  Fluttering among the olives wantonly,
  That seemed to live, so like it was in sight;
  The velvet nap which on his wings doth lie,
  The silken down with which his back is dight,
  His broad outstretched horns, his hairy thighs,
  His glorious colours, and his glistening eyes."*

  "Which when Arachne saw, as overlaid
  And mastered with workmanship so rare,
  She stood astonied long, ne aught gainsaid;
  And with fast-fixed eyes on her did stare,
  And by her silence, sign of one dismayed,
  The victory did yield her as her share:
  Yet did she inly fret and felly burn,
  And all her blood to poisonous rancour turn."

  * Sir James Mackintosh says of this, "Do you think that even a
  Chinese could paint the gay colours of a butterfly with more minute
  exactness than the following lines: 'The velvet nap,' etc.?"- Life,
  Vol. II. 246.

  And so the metamorphosis is caused by Arachne's own mortification
  and vexation, and not by any direct act of the goddess.

  The following specimen of old-fashioned gallantry is by Garrick:

  "UPON A LADY'S EMBROIDERY

  "Arachne once, as poets tell,
  A goddess at her art defied,
  And soon the daring mortal fell
  The hapless victim of her pride.

  "O, then beware Arachne's fate;
  Be prudent, Chloe, and submit,
  For you'll most surely meet her hate,
  Who rival both her art and wit."

  Tennyson, in his "Palace of Art," describing the works of art with
  which the palace was adorned, thus alludes to Europa:

  "...sweet Europa's mantle blew unclasped
  From off her shoulder, backward borne,
  From one hand drooped a crocus, one hand grasped
  The mild bull's golden horn."

  In his "Princess" there is this allusion to Danae:

  "Now lies the earth all Danae to the stars,
  And all thy heart lies open unto me."
