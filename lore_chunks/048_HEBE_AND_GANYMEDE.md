HEBE AND GANYMEDE
  Hebe, the daughter of Juno, and goddess of youth, was cup-bearer
  to the gods. The usual story is that she resigned her office on
  becoming the wife of Hercules. But there is another statement which
  our countryman Crawford, the sculptor, has adopted in his group of
  Hebe and Ganymede, now in the Athenaeum gallery. According to this,
  Hebe was dismissed from her office in consequence of a fall which
  she met with one day when in attendance on the gods. Her successor was
  Ganymede, a Trojan boy, whom Jupiter, in the disguise of an eagle,
  seized and carried off from the midst of his play-fellows on Mount
  Ida, bore up to heaven, and installed in the vacant place.

  Tennyson, in his "Palace of Art," describes among the decorations on
  the walls a picture representing this legend:

  "There, too, flushed Ganymede, his rosy thigh
  Half buried in the eagle's down,
  Sole as a flying star shot through the sky
  Above the pillared town."

  And in Shelley's "Prometheus" Jupiter calls to his cup-bearer thus:

  "Pour forth heaven's wine, Idaean Ganymede,
  And let it fill the Daedal cups like fire."

  The beautiful legend of the "Choice of Hercules" may be found in the
  "Tatler," No. 97.
