ORACLE OF APIS
  At Memphis the sacred bull Apis gave answer to those who consulted
  him by the manner in which he received or rejected what was
  presented to him. If the bull refused food from the hand of the
  inquirer it was considered an unfavourable sign, and the contrary when
  he received it.
  It has been a question whether oracular responses ought to be
  ascribed to mere human contrivance or to the agency of evil spirits.
  The latter opinion has been most general in past ages. A third
  theory has been advanced since the phenomena of Mesmerism have
  attracted attention, that something like the mesmeric trance was
  induced in the Pythoness, and the faculty of clairvoyance really
  called into action.
  Another question is as to the time when the Pagan oracles ceased
  to give responses. Ancient Christian writers assert that they became
  silent at the birth of Christ, and were heard no more after that date.
  Milton adopts this view in his "Hymn on the Nativity," and in lines of
  solemn and elevated beauty pictures the consternation of the heathen
  idols at the advent of the Saviour:

  "The oracles are dumb;
  No voice or hideous hum
  Rings through the arched roof in words deceiving.
  Apollo from his shrine
  Can no more divine,
  With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.
  No nightly trance or breathed spell
  Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell."

  In Cowper's poem of "Yardley Oak" there are some beautiful
  mythological allusions. The former of the two following is to the
  fable of Castor and Pollux; the latter is more appropriate to our
  present subject. Addressing the acorn he says,

  "Thou fell'st mature; and in the loamy clod,
  Swelling with vegetative force instinct,
  Didst burst thine egg, as theirs the fabled Twins
  Now stars; two lobes protruding, paired exact;
  A leaf succeeded and another leaf,
  And, all the elements thy puny growth
  Fostering propitious, thou becam'st a twig.
  Who lived when thou wast such? O, couldst thou speak,
  As in Dodona once thy kindred trees
  Oracular, I would not curious ask
  The future, best unknown, but at thy mouth
  Inquisitive, the less ambiguous past."

  Tennyson, in his "Talking Oak," alludes to the oaks of Dodona in
  these lines:

  "And I will work in prose and rhyme,
  And praise thee more in both
  Than bard has honored beech or lime,
  Or that Thessalian growth
  In which the swarthy ring-dove sat
  And mystic sentence spoke;" etc.

  Byron alludes to the oracle of Delphi where, speaking of Rousseau,
  whose writings he conceives did much to bring on the French
  revolution, he says,

  "For then he was inspired, and from him came,
  As from the Pythian's mystic cave of yore,
  Those oracles which set the world in flame,
  Nor ceased to burn till kingdoms were no more."
