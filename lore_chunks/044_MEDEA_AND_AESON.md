MEDEA AND AESON
  Amid the rejoicings for the recovery of the Golden Fleece, Jason
  felt that one thing was wanting, the presence of AEson, his father,
  who was prevented by his age and infirmities from taking part in them.
  Jason said to Medea, "My spouse, would that your arts, whose power I
  have seen so mighty for my aid, could do me one further service,
  take some years from my life and add them to my father's." Medea
  replied, "Not at such a cost shall it be done, but if my art avails
  me, his life shall be lengthened without abridging yours." The next
  full moon she issued forth alone, while all creatures slept; not a
  breath stirred the foliage, and all was still, To the stars she
  addressed her incantations, and to the moon; to Hecate,* the goddess
  of the under-world, and to Tellus the goddess of the earth, by whose
  power plants potent for enchantment are produced. She invoked the gods
  of the woods and caverns, of mountains and valleys, of lakes and
  rivers, of winds and vapours. While she spoke the stars shone
  brighter, and presently a chariot descended through the air, drawn
  by flying serpents. She ascended it, and borne aloft made her way to
  distant regions, where potent plants grew which she knew how to select
  for her purpose. Nine nights she employed in her search, and during
  that time came not within the doors of her palace nor under any
  roof, and shunned all intercourse with mortals.

  * Hecate was a mysterious divinity sometimes identified with Diana
  and sometimes with Proserpine. As Diana represents the moonlight
  splendour of night, so Hecate represents its darkness and terrors. She
  was the goddess of sorcery and witchcraft, and was believed to
  wander by night along the earth, seen only by the dogs, whose
  barking told her approach.

  She next erected two altars, the one to Hecate, the other to Hebe,
  the goddess of youth, and sacrificed a black sheep, pouring
  libations of milk and wine. She implored Pluto and his stolen bride
  that they would not hasten to take the old man's life. Then she
  directed that AEson should be led forth, and having thrown him into
  a deep sleep by a charm, had him laid on a bed of herbs, like one
  dead. Jason and all others were kept away from the place, that no
  profane eyes might look upon her mysteries. Then, with streaming hair,
  she thrice moved round the altars, dipped flaming twigs in the
  blood, and laid them thereon to burn. Meanwhile the cauldron with
  its contents was got ready. In it she put magic herbs, with seeds
  and flowers of acrid juice, stones from the distant east, and sand
  from the shore of all-surrounding ocean; hoar frost, gathered by
  moonlight, a screech owl's head and wings, and the entrails of a wolf.
  She added fragments of the shells of tortoises, and the liver of
  stags- animals tenacious of life- and the head and beak of a crow,
  that outlives nine generations of men. These with many other things
  "without a name" she boiled together for her purposed work, stirring
  them up with a dry olive branch; and behold! the branch when taken out
  instantly became green, and before long was covered with leaves and
  a plentiful growth of young olives; and as the liquor boiled and
  bubbled, and sometimes ran over, the grass wherever the sprinklings
  fell shot forth with a verdure like that of spring.
  Seeing that all was ready, Medea cut the throat of the old man and
  let out all his blood, and poured into his mouth and into his wound
  the juices of her cauldron. As soon as he had completely imbibed them,
  his hair and beard laid by their whiteness and assumed the blackness
  of youth; his paleness and emaciation were gone; his veins were full
  of blood, his limbs of vigour and robustness. AEson is amazed at
  himself, and remembers that such as he now is, he was in his
  youthful days, forty years before.
  Medea used her arts here for a good purpose, but not so in another
  instance, where she made them the instruments of revenge. Pelias,
  our readers will recollect, was the usurping uncle of Jason, and had
  kept him out of his kingdom. Yet he must have had some good qualities,
  for his daughters loved him, and when they saw what Medea had done for
  AEson, they wished her to do the same for their father. Medea
  pretended to consent, and prepared her cauldron as before. At her
  request an old sheep was brought and plunged into the cauldron. Very
  soon a bleating was heard in the kettle, and when the cover was
  removed, a lamb jumped forth and ran frisking away into the meadow.
  The daughters of Pelias saw the experiment with delight, and appointed
  a time for their father to undergo the same operation. But Medea
  prepared her cauldron for him in a very different way. She put in only
  water and a few simple herbs. In the night she with the sisters
  entered the bed chamber of the old king, while he and his guards slept
  soundly under the influence of a spell cast upon them by Medea. The
  daughters stood by the bedside with their weapons drawn, but hesitated
  to strike, till Medea chid their irresolution. Then turning away their
  faces, and giving random blows they smote him with their weapons.
  He, starting from his sleep, cried out, "My daughters, what are you
  doing? Will you kill your father?" Their hearts failed them and
  their weapons fell from their hands, but Medea struck him a fatal
  blow, and prevented his saying more.
  Then they placed him in the cauldron, and Medea hastened to depart
  in her serpent-drawn chariot before they discovered her treachery or
  their vengeance would have been terrible. She escaped, however, but
  had little enjoyment of the fruits of her crime. Jason, for whom she
  had done so much, wishing to marry Creusa, princess of Corinth, put
  away Medea. She, enraged at his ingratitude, called on the gods for
  vengeance, sent a poisoned robe as a gift to the bride, and then
  killing her own children, and setting fire to the palace, mounted
  her serpent-drawn chariot and fled to Athens, where she married King
  AEgeus, the father of Theseus, and we shall meet her again when we
  come to the adventures of that hero.

  The incantations of Medea will remind the reader of those of the
  witches in "Macbeth." The following lines are those which seem most
  strikingly to recall the ancient model:

  "Round about the cauldron go;
  In the poisoned entrails throw.

  Fillet of a fenny snake
  In the cauldron boil and bake;
  Eye of newt and toe of frog,
  Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
  Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
  Lizard's leg and howlet's wing;

  Maw of ravening salt-sea shark,
  Root of hemlock digged in the dark," etc.
  Macbeth, Act IV. Scene I.

  And again:

  Macbeth.- What is't you do?
  Witches.- A deed without a name.

  There is another story of Medea almost too revolting for record even
  of a sorceress, a class of persons to whom both ancient and modern
  poets have been accustomed to attribute every degree of atrocity. In
  her flight from Colchis she had taken her young brother Absyrtus
  with her. Finding the pursuing vessels of AEetes gaining upon the
  Argonauts, she caused the lad to be killed and his limbs to be
  strewn over the sea. AEetes on reaching the place found these
  sorrowful traces of his murdered son; but while he tarried to
  collect the scattered fragments and bestow upon them an honourable
  interment, the Argonauts escaped.
  In the poems of Campbell will be found a translation of one of the
  choruses of the tragedy of "Medea," where the poet Euripides has taken
  advantage of the occasion to pay a glowing tribute to Athens, his
  native city. It begins thus:

  "O haggard queen! to Athens dost thou guide
  Thy glowing chariot, steeped in kindred gore;
  Or seek to hide thy damned parricide
  Where peace and justice dwell for evermore?"
