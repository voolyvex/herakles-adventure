THE GOLDEN FLEECE
  IN very ancient times there lived in Thessaly a king and queen
  name Athamas and Nephele. They had two children, a boy and a girl.
  After a time Athamas grew indifferent to his wife, put her away, and
  took another. Nephele suspected danger to her children from the
  influence of the step-mother, and took measures to send them out of
  her reach. Mercury assisted her, and gave her a ram with a golden
  fleece, on which she set the two children, trusting that the ram would
  convey them to a place of safety. The ram vaulted into the air with
  the children on his back, taking his course to the East, till when
  crossing the strait that divides Europe and Asia, the girl, whose name
  was Helle, fell from his back into the sea, which from her was
  called the Hellespont,- now the Dardanelles. The ram continued his
  career till he reached the kingdom of Colchis, on the eastern shore of
  the Black Sea, where he safely landed the boy Phryxus, who was
  hospitably received by AEetes, king of the country. Phryxus sacrificed
  the ram to Jupiter, and gave the Golden Fleece to AEetes, who placed
  it in a consecrated rove, under the care of a sleepless dragon.
  There was another kingdom in Thessaly near to that of Athamas, and
  ruled over by a relative of his. The king AEson, being tired of the
  cares of government, surrendered his crown to his brother Pelias on
  condition that he should hold it only during the minority of Jason,
  the son of AEson. When Jason was grown up and came to demand the crown
  from his uncle, Pelias pretended to be willing to yield it, but at the
  same time suggested to the young man the glorious adventure of going
  in quest of the Golden Fleece, which it was well known was in the
  kingdom of Colchis, and was, as Pelias pretended, the rightful
  property of their family. Jason was pleased, with the thought and
  forthwith made preparations for the expedition. At that time the
  only species of navigation known to the Greeks consisted of small
  boats or canoes hollowed out from trunks of trees, so that when
  Jason employed Argus to build him a vessel capable of containing fifty
  men, it was considered a gigantic undertaking. It was accomplished,
  however, and the vessel named "Argo," from the name of the builder.
  Jason sent his invitation to all the adventurous young men of
  Greece, and soon found himself at the head of a band of bold youths,
  many of whom afterwards were renowned among the heroes and demigods of
  Greece. Hercules, Theseus, Orpheus, and Nestor were among them. They
  are called the Argonauts, from the name of their vessel.
  The "Argo" with her crew of heroes of Thessaly and having touched at
  the Island of Lemnos, thence crossed to Mysia and thence to Thrace.
  Here they found the sage Phineus, and from him received instruction as
  to their future course. It seems the entrance of the Euxine Sea was
  impeded by two small rocky islands, which floated on the surface,
  and in their tossings and heavings occasionally came together,
  crushing and grinding to atoms any object that might be caught between
  them. They were called the Symplegades, or Clashing Islands. Phineus
  instructed the Argonauts how to pass this dangerous strait. When
  they reached the islands they let go a dove, which took her way
  between the rocks, and passed in safety, only losing some feathers
  of her tail. Jason and his men seized the favourable moment of the
  rebound, plied their oars with vigour, and passed safe through, though
  the islands closed behind them, and actually grazed their stern.
  They now rowed along the shore till they arrived at the eastern end of
  the sea, and landed at the kingdom of Colchis.
  Jason made known his message to the Colchian king, AEetes, who
  consented to give tip the golden fleece if Jason would yoke to the
  plough two fire-breathing bulls with brazen feet, and sow the teeth of
  the dragon which Cadmus had slain, and from which it was well known
  that a crop of armed men would spring up, who would turn their weapons
  against their producer. Jason accepted the conditions, and a time
  was set for making the experiment. Previously, however, he found means
  to plead his cause to Medea, daughter of the king. He promised her
  marriage, and as they stood before the altar of Hecate, called the
  goddess to witness his oath. Medea yielded, and by her aid, for she
  was a potent sorceress, he was furnished with a charm, by which he
  could encounter safely the breath of the fire-breathing bulls and
  the weapons of the armed men.
  At the time appointed, the people assembled at the grove of Mars,
  and the king assumed his royal seat, while the multitude covered the
  hill-sides. The brazen-footed bulls rushed in, breathing fire from
  their nostrils that burned up the herbage as they passed. The sound
  was like the roar of a furnace, and the smoke like that of water
  upon quick-lime. Jason advanced boldly to meet them. His friends,
  the chosen heroes of Greece, trembled to behold him. Regardless of the
  burning breath, he soothed their rage with his voice, patted their
  necks with fearless hand, and adroitly slipped over them the yoke, and
  compelled them to drag the plough. The Colchians were amazed; the
  Greeks shouted for joy. Jason next proceeded to sow the dragon's teeth
  and plough them in. And soon the crop of armed men sprang up, and,
  wonderful to relate! no sooner had they reached the surface than
  they began to brandish their weapons and rush upon Jason. The Greeks
  trembled for their hero, and even she who had provided him a way of
  safety and taught him how to use it, Medea herself, grew pale with
  fear. Jason for a time kept his assailants at bay with his sword and
  shield, till, finding their numbers overwhelming, he resorted to the
  charm which Medea had taught him, seized a stone and threw it in the
  midst of his foes. They immediately turned their arms against one
  another, and soon there was not one of the dragon's brood left
  alive. The Greeks embraced their hero, and Medea, if she dared,
  would have embraced him too.
  It remained to lull to sleep the dragon that guarded the fleece, and
  this was done by scattering over him a few drops of a preparation
  which Medea had supplied. At the smell he relaxed his rage, stood
  for a moment motionless, then shut those great round eyes, that had
  never been known to shut before, and turned over on his side, fast
  asleep. Jason seized the fleece and with his friends and Medea
  accompanying, hastened to their vessel before AEetes the king could
  arrest their departure, and made the best of their way back to
  Thessaly, where they arrived safe, and Jason delivered the fleece to
  Pelias, and dedicated the "Argo" to Neptune. What became of the fleece
  afterwards we do not know, but perhaps it was found after all, like
  many other golden prizes, not worth the trouble it had cost to procure
  it.

  This is one of those mythological tales, says a late writer, in
  which there is reason to believe that a substratum of truth exists,
  though overlaid by a mass of fiction. It probably was the first
  important maritime expedition, and like the first attempts of the kind
  of all nations, as we know from history, was probably of a
  half-piratical character. If rich spoils were the result it was enough
  to give rise to the idea of the golden fleece.
  Another suggestion of a learned mythologist, Bryant, is that it is a
  corrupt tradition of the story of Noah and the ark. The name "Argo"
  seems to countenance this, and the incident of the dove is another
  confirmation.

  Pope, in his "Ode on St. Cecilia's Day," thus celebrates the
  launching of the ship "Argo," and the power of the music of Orpheus,
  whom he calls the Thracian:

  "So when the first bold vessel dared the seas,
  High on the stern the Thracian raised his strain,
  While Argo saw her kindred trees
  Descend from Pelion to the main.
  Transported demigods stood round,
  And men grew heroes at the sound."

  In Dyer's poem of "The Fleece" there is an account of the ship
  "Argo" and her crew, which gives a good picture of this primitive
  maritime adventure:

  "From every region of AEgea's shore
  The brave assembled; those illustrious twins
  Castor and Pollux; Orpheus, tuneful bard;
  Zetes and Calais, as the wind in speed;
  Strong Hercules and many a chief renowned.
  On deep Ioclos' sandy shore they thronged,
  Gleaming in armour, ardent of exploits;
  And soon, the laurel cord and the huge stone
  Uplifting to the deck, unmoored the bark;
  Whose keel of wondrous length the skilful hand
  Of Argus fashioned for the proud attempt;
  And in the extended keel a lofty mast
  Upraised, and sails full swelling; to the chiefs
  Unwonted objects. Now first, now they learned
  Their bolder steerage over ocean wave,
  Led by the golden stars, as Chiron's art
  Had marked the sphere celestial," etc.

  Hercules left the expedition at Mysia, for Hylas, a youth beloved by
  him, having gone for water, was laid hold of and kept by the nymphs of
  the spring, who were fascinated by his beauty. Hercules went in
  quest of the lad, and while he was absent the "Argo" put to sea and
  left him. Moore, in one of his songs, makes a beautiful allusion to
  this incident:

  "When Hylas was sent with his urn to the fount,
  Through fields of light and with heart full of play,
  Light rambled the boy over meadow and mount,
  And neglected his task for the flowers in the way.

  "Thus many like me, who in youth should have tasted
  The fountain that runs by Philosophy's shrine,
  Their time with the flowers on the margin have wasted,
  And left their light urns all as empty as mine."
