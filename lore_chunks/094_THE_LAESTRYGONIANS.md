THE LAESTRYGONIANS
  Their next adventure was with the barbarous tribe of Laestrygonians.
  The vessels all pushed into the harbour, tempted by the secure
  appearance of the cove, completely land-locked; only Ulysses moored
  his vessel without. As soon as the Laestrygonians found the ships
  completely in their power they attacked them, heaving huge stones
  which broke and overturned them, and with their spears despatched
  the seamen as they struggled in the water. All the vessels with
  their crews were destroyed, except Ulysses' own ship, which had
  remained outside, and finding no safety but in flight, he exhorted his
  men to ply their oars vigorously, and they escaped.
  With grief for their slain companions mixed with joy at their own
  escape, they pursued their way till they arrived at the AEaean isle,
  where Circe dwelt, the daughter of the sun. Landing here, Ulysses
  climbed a hill, and gazing round saw no signs of habitation except
  in one spot at the centre of the island, where he perceived a palace
  embowered with trees. He sent forward one-half of his crew, under
  the command of Eurylochus, to see what prospect of hospitality they
  might find. As they approached the palace, they found themselves
  surrounded by lions, tigers, and wolves, not fierce, but tamed by
  Circe's art, for she was a powerful magician. All these animals had
  once been men, but had been changed by Circe's enchantments into the
  forms of beasts. The sounds of soft music were heard from within,
  and a sweet female voice singing. Eurylochus called aloud and the
  goddess came forth and invited them in; they all gladly entered except
  Eurylochus, who suspected danger. The goddess conducted her guests
  to a seat, and had them served with wine and other delicacies. When
  they had feasted heartily, she touched them one by one with her
  wand, and they became immediately changed into swine, in "head,
  body, voice, and bristles," yet with their intellects as before. She
  shut them in her sties and supplied them with acorns and such other
  things as swine love.
  Eurylochus hurried back to the ship and told the tale. Ulysses
  thereupon determined to go himself, and try if by any means he might
  deliver his companions. As he strode onward alone, he met a youth
  who addressed him familiarly, appearing to be acquainted with his
  adventures. He announced himself as Mercury, and informed Ulysses of
  the arts of Circe, and of the danger of approaching her. As Ulysses
  was not to be dissuaded from his attempt, Mercury provided him with
  a sprig of the plant Moly, of wonderful power to resist sorceries, and
  instructed him how to act. Ulysses proceeded, and reaching the
  palace was courteously received by Circe, who entertained him as she
  had done his companions, and after he had eaten and drank, touched him
  with her wand, saying, "Hence, seek the sty and wallow with thy
  friends." But he, instead of obeying, drew his sword and rushed upon
  her with fury in his countenance. She fell on her knees and begged for
  mercy. He dictated a solemn oath that she would release his companions
  and practise no further harm against him or them; and she repeated it,
  at the same time promising to dismiss them all in safety after
  hospitably entertaining them. She was as good as her word. The men
  were restored to their shapes, the rest of the crew summoned from
  the shore, and the whole magnificently entertained day after day, till
  Ulysses seemed to have forgotten his native land, and to have
  reconciled himself to an inglorious life of ease and pleasure.
  At length his companions recalled him to nobler sentiments, and he
  received their admonition gratefully. Circe aided their departure, and
  instructed them how to pass safely by the coast of the Sirens. The
  Sirens were sea-nymphs who had the power of charming by their song all
  who heard them, so that the unhappy mariners were irresistibly
  impelled to cast themselves into the sea to their destruction. Circe
  directed Ulysses to fill the ears of his seamen with wax, so that they
  should not hear the strain; and to cause himself to be bound to the
  mast, and his people to be strictly enjoined, whatever he might say or
  do, by no means to release him till they should have passed the
  Sirens' island. Ulysses obeyed these directions. He filled the ears of
  his people with wax, and suffered them to bind him with cords firmly
  to the mast. As they approached the Sirens' island, the sea was
  calm, and over the waters came the notes of music so ravishing and
  attractive that Ulysses struggled to get loose, and by cries and signs
  to his people begged to be released; but they, obedient to his
  previous orders, sprang forward and bound him still faster. They
  held on their course, and the music grew fainter till it ceased to
  be heard, when with joy Ulysses gave his companions the signal to
  unseal their ears, and they relieved him from his bonds.

  The imagination of a modern poet, Keats, has discovered for us the
  thoughts that passed through the brains of the victims of Circe, after
  their transformation. In his "Endymion" he represents one of them, a
  monarch in the guise of an elephant, addressing the sorceress in human
  language, thus:

  "I sue not for my happy crown again;
  I sue not for my phalanx on the plain;
  I sue not for my lone, my widowed wife;
  I sue not for my ruddy drops of life,
  My children fair, my lovely girls and boys;
  I will forget them; I will pass these joys,
  Ask nought so heavenward; so too- too high;
  Only I pray, as fairest boon, to die;
  To be delivered from this cumbrous flesh,
  From this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,
  And merely given to the cold, bleak air.
  Have mercy, goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!"
