THE WINDS
  When so many less active agencies were personified, it is not to
  be supposed that the winds failed to be so. They were Boreas or
  Aquilo, the north wind; Zephyrus or Favonius, the west; Notus or
  Auster, the south; and Eurus, the east. The first two have been
  chiefly celebrated by the poets, the former as the type of rudeness,
  the latter of gentleness. Boreas loved the nymph Orithyia, and tried
  to play the lover's part, but met with poor success. It was hard for
  him to breathe gently, and sighing was out of the question. Weary at
  last of fruitless endeavours, he acted out his true character,
  seized the maiden and carried her off. Their children were Zetes and
  Calais, winged warriors, who accompanied the Argonautic expedition,
  and did good service in an encounter with those monstrous birds the
  Harpies.

  Zephyrus was the lover of Flora. Milton alludes to them in "Paradise
  Lost," where he describes Adam waking and contemplating Eve still
  asleep.

  "...He on his side
  Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love,
  Hung over her enamoured, and beheld
  Beauty which; whether waking or asleep,
  Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice,
  Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,
  Her hand soft touching, whispered thus: 'Awake!
  My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,
  Heaven's last, best gift, my ever-new delight.'"

  Dr. Young, the poet of the "Night Thoughts," addressing the idle and
  luxurious, says:

  "Ye delicate! who nothing can support
  (Yourselves most insupportable) for whom
  The winter rose must blow,...
  ....and silky soft
  Favonius breathe still softer or be chid!"
