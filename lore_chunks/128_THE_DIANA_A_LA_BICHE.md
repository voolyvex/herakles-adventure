THE DIANA A LA BICHE
  The Diana of the Hind, in the palace of the Louvre, may be
  considered the counterpart to the Apollo Belvedere. The attitude
  much resembles that of the Apollo, the sizes correspond and also the
  style of execution. It is a work of the highest order, though by no
  means equal to the Apollo. The attitude is that of hurried and eager
  motion, the face that of a huntress in the excitement of the chase.
  The left hand is extended over the forehead of the Hind, which runs by
  her side, the right arm reaches backward over the shoulder to draw
  an arrow from the quiver.
