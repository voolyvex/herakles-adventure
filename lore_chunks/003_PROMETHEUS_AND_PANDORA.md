PROMETHEUS AND PANDORA
  THE creation of the world is a problem naturally fitted to excite
  the liveliest interest of man, its inhabitant. The ancient pagans, not
  having the information on the subject which we derive from the pages
  of Scripture, had their own way of telling the story, which is as
  follows:
  Before earth and sea and heaven were created, all things wore one
  aspect, to which we give the name of Chaos- a confused and shapeless
  mass, nothing but dead weight, in which, however, slumbered the
  seeds of things. Earth, sea, and air were all mixed up together; so
  the earth was not solid, the sea was not fluid, and the air was not
  transparent. God and Nature at last interposed, and put an end to this
  discord, separating earth from sea, and heaven from both. The fiery
  part, being the lightest, sprang up, and formed the skies; the air was
  next in weight and place. The earth, being heavier, sank below; and
  the water took the lowest place, and buoyed up the earth.
  Here some god- it is not known which- gave his good offices in
  arranging and disposing the earth. He appointed rivers and bays
  their places, raised mountains, scooped out valleys, distributed
  woods, fountains, fertile fields. and stony plains. The air being
  cleared, the stars began to appear, fishes took possession of the sea,
  birds of the air, and four-footed beasts of the land.
  But a nobler animal was wanted, and Man was made. It is not known
  whether the creator made him of divine materials, or whether in the
  earth, so lately separated from heaven, there lurked still some
  heavenly seeds. Prometheus took some of this earth, and kneading it up
  with water, made man in the image of the gods. He gave him an
  upright stature, so that while all other animals turn their faces
  downward, and look to the earth, he raises his to heaven, and gazes on
  the stars.
  Prometheus was one of the Titans, a gigantic race, who inhabited the
  earth before the creation of man. To him and his brother Epimetheus
  was committed the office of making man, and providing him and all
  other animals with the faculties necessary for their preservation.
  Epimetheus undertook to do this, and Prometheus was to overlook his
  work, when it was done. Epimetheus accordingly proceeded to bestow
  upon the different animals the various gifts of courage, strength,
  swiftness, sagacity; wings to one, claws to another, a shelly covering
  to a third, etc. But when man came to be provided for, who was to be
  superior to all other animals, Epimetheus had been so prodigal of
  his resources that he had nothing left to bestow upon him. In his
  perplexity he resorted to his brother Prometheus, who, with the aid of
  Minerva, went up to heaven, and lighted his torch at the chariot of
  the sun. and brought down fire to man. With this gift man was more
  than a match for all other animals. It enabled him to make weapons
  wherewith to subdue them; tools with which to cultivate the earth;
  to warm his dwelling, so as to be comparatively independent of
  climate; and finally to introduce the arts and to coin money, the
  means of trade and commerce.
  Woman was not yet made. The story (absurd enough!) is that Jupiter
  made her, and sent her to Prometheus and his brother, to punish them
  for their presumption in stealing fire from heaven; and man, for
  accepting the gift. The first woman was named Pandora. She was made in
  heaven, every god contributing something to perfect her. Venus gave
  her beauty, Mercury persuasion, Apollo music, etc. Thus equipped,
  she was conveyed to earth, and presented to Epimetheus, who gladly
  accepted her, though cautioned by his brother to beware of Jupiter and
  his gifts. Epimetheus had in his house a jar, in which were kept
  certain noxious articles for which, in fitting man for his new
  abode, he had had no occasion. Pandora was seized with an eager
  curiosity to know what this jar contained; and one day she slipped off
  the cover and looked in. Forthwith there escaped a multitude of
  plagues for hapless man,- such as gout, rheumatism, and colic for
  his body, and envy, spite, and revenge for his mind,- and scattered
  themselves far and wide. Pandora hastened to replace the lid! but,
  alas! the whole contents of the jar had escaped, one thing only
  excepted, which lay at the bottom, and that was hope. So we see at
  this day, whatever evils are abroad, hope never entirely leaves us;
  and while we have that, no amount of other ills can make us completely
  wretched.
  Another story is that Pandora was sent in good faith, by Jupiter, to
  bless man; that she was furnished with a box containing her marriage
  presents, into which every god had put some blessing, She opened the
  box incautiously, and the blessings all escaped, hope only excepted.
  This story seems more probable than the former; for how could hope, so
  precious a jewel as it is, have been kept in a jar full of all
  manner of evils, as in the former statement?
  The world being thus furnished with inhabitants, the first age was
  an age of innocence and happiness, called the Golden Age. Truth and
  right prevailed, though not enforced by law, nor was there any
  magistrate to threaten or punish. The forest had not yet been robbed
  of its trees to furnish timbers for vessels, nor had men built
  fortifications round their towns. There were no such things as swords,
  spears, or helmets. The earth brought forth all things necessary for
  man, without his labour in ploughing or sowing, Perpetual spring
  reigned, flowers sprang up without seed, the rivers flowed with milk
  and wine, and yellow honey distilled from the oaks.
  Then succeeded the Silver Age, inferior to the golden, but better
  than that of brass. Jupiter shortened the spring, and divided the year
  into seasons. Then, first, men had to endure the extremes of heat
  and cold, and houses became necessary. Caves were the first dwellings,
  and leafy coverts of the woods, and huts woven of twigs. Crops would
  no longer grow without planting. The farmer was obliged to sow the
  seed, and the toiling ox to draw the plough.
  Next came the Brazen Age, more savage of temper, and readier to
  the strife of arms, yet not altogether wicked. The hardest and worst
  was the Iron Age. Crime burst in like a flood; modesty, truth, and
  honour fled. In their places came fraud and cunning, violence, and the
  wicked love of gain. Then seamen spread sails to the wind, and the
  trees were torn from the mountains to serve for keels to ships, and
  vex the face of the ocean. The earth, which till now had been
  cultivated in common, began to be divided off into possessions. Men
  were not satisfied with what the surface produced, but must dig into
  its bowels, and draw forth from thence the ores of metals. Mischievous
  iron, and more mischievous gold, were produced. War sprang up, using
  both as weapons; the guest was not safe in his friend's house; and
  sons-in-law and fathers-in-law, brothers and sisters, husbands and
  wives, could not trust one another. Sons wished their fathers dead,
  that they might come to the inheritance; family love lay prostrate.
  The earth was wet with slaughter, and the gods abandoned it, one by
  one, till Astraea* alone was left, and finally she also took her
  departure.

  * The goddess of innocence and purity. After leaving earth, she
  was placed among the stars, where she became the constellation
  Virgo- the Virgin. Themis (Justice) was the mother of Astraea. She
  is represented as holding aloft a pair of scales, in which she
  weighs the claims of opposing parties.
  It was a favourite idea of the old poets that these goddesses
  would one day return, and bring back the Golden Age. Even in a
  Christian hymn, the "Messiah" of Pope, this idea occurs:

  "All crimes shall cease, and ancient fraud shall fail,
  Returning Justice lift aloft her scale,
  Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend,
  And white-robed Innocence from heaven descend."

  See, also, Milton's "Hymn on the Nativity," stanzas xiv. and xv.

  Jupiter, seeing this state of things, burned with anger. He summoned
  the gods to council. They obeyed the call, and took the road to the
  palace of heaven. The road, which any one may see in a clear night,
  stretches across the face of the sky, and is called the Milky Way.
  Along the road stand the palaces of the illustrious gods; the common
  people of the skies live apart, on either side. Jupiter addressed
  the assembly. He set forth the frightful condition of things on the
  earth, and closed by announcing his intention to destroy the whole
  of its inhabitants, and provide a new race, unlike the first, who
  would be more worthy of life, and much better worshippers of the gods.
  So saying he took a thunderbolt, and was about to launch it at the
  world, and destroy it by burning; but recollecting the danger that
  such a conflagration might set heaven itself on fire, he changed his
  plan, and resolved to drown it. The north wind, which scatters the
  clouds, was chained up; the south was sent out, and soon covered all
  the face of heaven with a cloak of pitchy darkness. The clouds, driven
  together, resound with a crash; torrents of rain fall; the crops are
  laid low; the year's labour of the husbandman perishes in an hour.
  Jupiter, not satisfied with his own waters, calls on his brother
  Neptune to aid him with his. He lets loose the rivers, and pours
  them over the land. At the same time, he heaves the land with an
  earthquake, and brings in the reflux of the ocean over the shores.
  Flocks, herds, men, and houses are swept away, and temples, with their
  sacred enclosures, profaned. If any edifice remained standing, it
  was overwhelmed, and its turrets lay hid beneath the waves. Now all
  was sea, sea without shore. Here and there an individual remained on a
  projecting hilltop, and a few, in boats, pulled the oar where they had
  lately driven the plough. The fishes swim among the tree-tops; the
  anchor is let down into a garden. Where the graceful lambs played
  but now. unwieldy sea calves gambol. The wolf swims among the sheep,
  the yellow lions and tigers struggle in the water. The strength of the
  wild boar serves him not, nor his swiftness the stag. The birds fall
  with weary win, into the water, having found no land for a
  resting-place. Those living beings whom the water spared fell a prey
  to hunger.
  Parnassus alone, of all the mountains, overtopped the waves; and
  there Deucalion, and his wife Pyrrha, of the race of Prometheus, found
  refuge- he a just man, and she a faithful worshipper of the gods.
  Jupiter, when he saw none left alive but this pair, and remembered
  their harmless lives and pious demeanour, ordered the north winds to
  drive away the clouds, and disclose the skies to earth, and earth to
  the skies. Neptune also directed Triton to blow on his shell, and
  sound a retreat to the waters. The waters obeyed, and the sea returned
  to its shores, and the rivers to their channels. Then Deucalion thus
  addressed Pyrrha: "O wife, only surviving woman, joined to me first by
  the ties of kindred and marriage, and now by a common danger, would
  that we possessed the power of our ancestor Prometheus, and could
  renew the race as he at first made it! But as we cannot, let us seek
  yonder temple, and inquire of the gods what remains for us to do."
  They entered the temple, deformed as it was with slime, and approached
  the altar, where no fire burned. There they fell prostrate on the
  earth, and prayed the goddess to inform them how they might retrieve
  their miserable affairs. The oracle answered, "Depart from the
  temple with head veiled and garments unbound, and cast behind you
  the bones of your mother." They heard the words with astonishment.
  Pyrrha first broke silence: "We cannot obey; we dare not profane the
  remains of our parents." They sought the thickest shades of the
  wood, and revolved the oracle in their minds. At length Deucalion
  spoke: "Either my sagacity deceives me, or the command is one we may
  obey without impiety. The earth is the great parent of all; the stones
  are her bones; these we may cast behind us; and I think this is what
  the oracle means. At least, it will do no harm to try." They veiled
  their faces, unbound their garments, and picked up stones, and cast
  them behind them. The stones (wonderful to relate) began to grow soft,
  and assume shape. By degrees, they put on a rude resemblance to the
  human form, like a block half finished in the hands of the sculptor.
  The moisture and slime that were about them became flesh; the stony
  part became bones; the veins remained veins, retaining their name,
  only changing their use. Those thrown by the hand of the man became
  men, and those by the woman became women. It was a hard race, and well
  adapted to labour, as we find ourselves to be at this day, giving
  plain indications of our origin.
  The comparison of Eve to Pandora is too obvious to have escaped
  Milton, who introduces it in Book IV. of "Paradise Lost":

  "More lovely than Pandora, whom the gods
  Endowed with all their gifts; and O, too like
  In sad event, when to the unwiser son
  Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she insnared
  Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged
  On him who had stole Jove's authentic fire."

  Prometheus and Epimetheus were sons of Iapetus, which Milton changes
  to Japhet.
  Prometheus has been a favourite subject with the poets. He is
  represented as the friend of mankind, who interposed in their behalf
  when Jove was incensed against them, and who taught them
  civilization and the arts. But as, in so doing, he transgressed the
  will of Jupiter, he drew down on himself the anger of the ruler of
  gods and men. Jupiter had him chained to a rock on Mount Caucasus,
  where a vulture preyed on his liver, which was renewed as fast as
  devoured. This state of torment might have been brought to an end at
  any time by Prometheus, if he had been willing, to submit to his
  oppressor; for he possessed a secret which involved the stability of
  Jove's throne, and if he would have revealed it, he might have been at
  once taken into favour. But that he disdained to do. He has
  therefore become the symbol of magnanimous endurance of unmerited
  suffering, and strength of will resisting oppression.
  Byron and Shelley have both treated this theme. The following are
  Byron's lines:

  "Titan! to whose immortal eyes
  The sufferings of mortality,
  Seen in their sad reality,
  Were not as things that gods despise;
  What was thy pity's recompense?
  A silent suffering, and intense;
  The rock, the vulture, and the chain;
  All that the proud can feel of pain;
  The agony they do not show;
  The suffocating sense of woe.

  "Thy godlike crime was to be kind;
  To render with thy precepts less
  The sum of human wretchedness,
  And strengthen man with his own mind.
  And, baffled as thou wert from high,
  Still, in thy patient energy
  In the endurance and repulse
  Of thine impenetrable spirit,
  Which earth and heaven could not convulse,
  A mighty lesson we inherit."

  Byron also employs the same allusion, in his "Ode to Napoleon
  Bonaparte":

  "Or, like the thief of fire from heaven,
  Wilt thou withstand the shock?
  And share with him- the unforgiven-
  His vulture and his rock?"
