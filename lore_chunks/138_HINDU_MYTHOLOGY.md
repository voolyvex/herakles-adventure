HINDU MYTHOLOGY
  The religion of the Hindus is professedly founded on the Vedas. To
  these books of their scripture they attach the greatest sanctity,
  and state that Brahma himself composed them at the creation. But the
  present arrangement of the Vedas is attributed to the sage Vyasa,
  about five thousand years ago.
  The Vedas undoubtedly teach the belief of one supreme God. The
  name of this deity is Brahma. His attributes are represented by the
  three personified powers of creation, preservation, and destruction,
  which under the respective names of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva form
  the Trimurti or triad of principal Hindu gods. Of the inferior gods
  the most important are: 1. Indra, the god of heaven, of thunder,
  lightning, storm, and rain; 2. Agni, the god of fire; 3. Yama, the god
  of the infernal regions; 4. Surya, the god of the sun.
  Brahma is the creator of the universe, and the source from which all
  the individual deities have sprung, and into which all will ultimately
  be absorbed. "As milk changes to curd, and water to ice, so is
  Brahma variously transformed and diversified, without aid of
  exterior means of any sort." The human soul, according to the Vedas,
  is a portion of the supreme ruler, as a spark is of the fire.
