THE WEDDING FEAST
  The joyful parents, with Perseus and Andromeda, repaired to the
  palace, where a banquet was spread for them, and all was joy and
  festivity. But suddenly a noise was heard of warlike clamour, and
  Phineus, the betrothed of the virgin, with a party of his adherents,
  burst in, demanding the maiden as his own. It was in vain that Cepheus
  remonstrated- "You should have claimed her when she lay bound to the
  rock, the monster's victim. The sentence of the gods dooming her to
  such a fate dissolved all engagements, as death itself would have
  done." Phineus made no reply, but hurled his javelin at Perseus, but
  it missed its mark and fell harmless. Perseus would have thrown his in
  turn, but the cowardly assailant ran and took shelter behind the
  altar. But his act was a signal for an onset by his hand upon the
  guests of Cepheus. They defended themselves and a general conflict
  ensued, the old king retreating from the scene after fruitless
  expostulations, calling the gods to witness that he was guiltless of
  this outrage on the rights of hospitality.
  Perseus and his friends maintained for some time the unequal
  contest; but the numbers of the assailants were too great for them,
  and destruction seemed inevitable, when a sudden thought struck
  Perseus,- "I will make my enemy defend me." Then with a loud voice
  he exclaimed, "If I have any friend here let him turn away his
  eyes!" and held aloft the Gorgon's head. "Seek not to frighten us with
  your jugglery," said Thescelus, and raised his javelin in the act to
  throw, and became stone in the very attitude. Ampyx was about to
  plunge his sword into the body of a prostrate foe, but his arm
  stiffened and he could neither thrust forward nor withdraw it.
  Another, in the midst of a vociferous challenge, stopped, his mouth
  open, but no sound issuing. One of Perseus's friends, Aconteus, caught
  sight of the Gorgon and stiffened like the rest. Astyages struck him
  with his sword, but instead of wounding, it recoiled with a ringing
  noise.
  Phineus beheld this dreadful result of his unjust aggression, and
  felt confounded. He called aloud to his friends, but got no answer; he
  touched them and found them stone. Falling on his knees and stretching
  out his hands to Perseus, but turning his head away, he begged for
  mercy. "Take all," said he, "give me but my life." "Base coward," said
  Perseus, "thus much I will grant you; no weapon shall touch you;
  moreover, you shall be preserved in my house as a memorial of these
  events." So saying, he held the Gorgon's head to the side where
  Phineus was looking, and in the very form which he knelt, with his
  hands outstretched and face averted, he became fixed immovably, a mass
  of stone!

  The following allusion to Perseus is from Milman's "Samor":

  "As 'mid the fabled Libyan bridal stood
  Perseus in stern tranquillity of wrath,
  Half stood, half floated on his ankle-plumes
  Out-swelling, while the bright face on his shield
  Looked into stone the raging fray; so rose,
  But with no magic arms, wearing alone
  Th' appalling and control of his firm look,
  The Briton Samor; at his rising awe
  Went abroad, and the riotous hall was mute."
