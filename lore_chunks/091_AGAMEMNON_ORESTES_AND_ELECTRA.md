AGAMEMNON, ORESTES AND ELECTRA
  Agamemnon, the general-in-chief of the Greeks, the brother of
  Menelaus, and who had been drawn into the quarrel to avenge his
  brother's wrongs, not his own, was not so fortunate in the issue.
  During his absence his wife Clytemnestra had been false to him, and
  when his return was expected, she with her paramour, AEgisthus, laid a
  plan for his destruction, and at the banquet given to celebrate his
  return, murdered him.
  It was intended by the conspirators to slay his son Orestes also,
  a lad not yet old enough to be an object of apprehension, but from
  whom, if he should be suffered to grow up, there might be danger.
  Electra, the sister of Orestes, saved her brother's life by sending
  him secretly away to his uncle Strophius, King of Phocis. In the
  palace of Strophius Orestes grew up with the king's son Pylades, and
  formed with him that ardent friendship which bas become proverbial.
  Electra frequently reminded her brother by messengers of the duty of
  avenging his father's death, and when grown up he consulted the oracle
  of Delphi, which confirmed him in his design. He therefore repaired in
  disguise to Argos, pretending to be a messenger from Strophius, who
  had come to announce the death of Orestes, and brought the ashes of
  the deceased in a funeral urn. After visiting his father's tomb and.
  sacrificing upon it, according to the rites of the ancients he made
  himself known to his sister Electra, and soon after slew both
  AEgisthus and Clytemnestra.
  This revolting act, the slaughter of a mother by her son, though
  alleviated by the guilt of the victim and the express command of the
  gods, did not fail to awaken in the breasts of the ancients the same
  abhorrence that it does in ours. The Eumenides, avenging deities,
  seized upon Orestes, and drove him frantic from land to land.
  Pylades accompanied him in his wanderings and watched over him. At
  length, in answer to a second appeal to the oracle, he was directed to
  go to Tauris in Scythia, and to bring thence a statue of Diana which
  was believed to have fallen from heaven. Accordingly Orestes and
  Pylades went to Tauris, where the barbarous people were accustomed
  to sacrifice to the goddess all strangers who fell into their hands.
  The two friends were seized and carried bound to the temple to be made
  victims. But the priestess of Diana was no other than Iphigenia, the
  sister of Orestes, who, our readers will remember, was snatched away
  by Diana at the moment when she was about to be sacrificed.
  Ascertaining from the prisoners who they were, Iphigenia disclosed
  herself to them, and the three made their escape with the statue of
  the goddess, and returned to Mycenae.
  But Orestes was not yet relieved from the vengeance of the
  Erinyes. At length he took refuge with Minerva at Athens. The
  goddess afforded him protection, and appointed the court of
  Areopagus to decide his fate. The Erinyes brought forward their
  accusation, and Orestes made the command of the Delphic oracle his
  excuse. When the court voted and the voices were equally divided,
  Orestes was acquitted by the command of Minerva.

  Byron, in "Childe Harold," Canto IV., alludes to the story of
  Orestes:

  "O thou who never yet of human wrong
  Left the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis!
  Thou who didst call the Furies from the abyss,
  And round Orestes bade them howl and hiss,
  For that unnatural retribution,-just
  Had it but been from hands less near,- in this,
  Thy former realm, I call thee from the dust!"

  One of the most pathetic scenes in the ancient drama is that in
  which Sophocles represents the meeting of Orestes and Electra, on
  his return from Phocis. Orestes, mistaking Electra for one of the
  domestics, and desirous of keeping his arrival a secret till the
  hour of vengeance should arrive, produces the urn in which his ashes
  are supposed to rest. Electra, believing him to be really dead,
  takes the urn and, embracing it, pours forth her grief in language
  full of tenderness and despair.

  Milton in one of his sonnets, says:

  "...The repeated air
  Of sad Electra's poet had the power
  To save the Athenian walls from ruin bare."

  This alludes to the story that when, on one occasion, the city of
  Athens was at the mercy of her Spartan foes, and it was proposed to
  destroy it, the thought was rejected upon the accidental quotation, by
  some one, of a chorus of Euripides.
