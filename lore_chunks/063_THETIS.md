THETIS
  Thetis, the daughter of Nereus and Doris, was so beautiful that
  Jupiter himself sought her in marriage; but having learned from
  Prometheus the Titan that Thetis should bear a son who should be
  greater than his father, Jupiter desisted from his suit and decreed
  that Thetis should be the wife of a mortal. By the aid of Chiron the
  Centaur, Peleus succeeded in winning the goddess for his bride and
  their son was the renowned Achilles. In our chapter on the Trojan
  war it will appear that Thetis was a faithful mother to him, aiding
  him in all difficulties, and watching over his interests from the
  first to the last.
