NISUS AND EURYALUS
  In the meanwhile Turnus had collected his bands and made all
  necessary preparations for the war. Juno sent Iris to him with a
  message inciting him to take advantage of the absence of AEneas and
  surprise the Trojan camp. Accordingly the attempt was made, but the
  Trojans were found on their guard, and having received strict orders
  from AEneas not to fight in his absence, they lay still in their
  intrenchments, and resisted all the efforts of the Rutulians to draw
  them into the field. Night coming on, the army of Turnus, in high
  spirits at their fancied superiority, feasted and enjoyed
  themselves, and finally stretched themselves on the field and slept
  secure.
  In the camp of the Trojans things were far otherwise. There all
  was watchfulness and anxiety and impatience for AEneas's return. Nisus
  stood guard at the entrance of the camp, and Euryalus, a youth
  distinguished above all in the army for graces of person and fine
  qualities, was with him. These two were friends and brothers in
  arms. Nisus said to his friend, "Do you perceive what confidence and
  carelessness the enemy display? Their lights are few and dim, and
  the men seem all oppressed with wine or sleep. You know how
  anxiously our chiefs wish to send to AEneas, and to get intelligence
  from him. Now, I am strongly moved to make my way through the
  enemy's camp and to go in search of our chief. If I succeed, the glory
  of the deed will be reward enough for me, and if they judge the
  service deserves anything more, let them pay it to you."
  Euryalus, all on fire with the love of adventure, replied, "Would
  you, then, Nisus, refuse to share your enterprise with me? And shall I
  let you go into such danger alone? Not so my brave father brought me
  up, nor so have I planned for myself when I joined the standard of
  AEneas, and resolved to hold my life cheap in comparison with honour."
  Nisus replied, "I doubt it not, my friend; but you know the
  uncertain event of such an undertaking, and whatever may happen to me,
  I wish you to be safe. You are younger than I and have more of life in
  prospect. Nor can I be the cause of such grief to your mother, who has
  chosen to be here in the camp with you rather than stay and live in
  peace with the other matrons in Acestes' city." Euryalus replied, "Say
  no more. In vain you seek arguments to dissuade me. I am fixed in
  the resolution to go with you. Let us lose no time." They called the
  guard, and committing the watch to them, sought the general's tent.
  They found the chief officers in consultation, deliberating how they
  should send notice to AEneas of their situation. The offer of the
  two friends was gladly accepted, themselves loaded with praises and
  promised the most liberal rewards in case of success. Iulus especially
  addressed Euryalus, assuring him of his lasting friendship. Euryalus
  replied, "I have but one boon to ask. My aged mother is with me in the
  camp. For me she left the Trojan soil, and would not stay behind
  with the other matrons at the city of Acestes. I go now without taking
  leave of her. I could not bear her tears nor set at nought her
  entreaties. But do thou, I beseech you, comfort her in her distress.
  Promise me that and I shall go more boldly into whatever dangers may
  present themselves." Iulus and the other chiefs were moved to tears,
  and promised to do all his request. "Your mother shall be mine,"
  said Iulus, "and all that I have promised to you shall be made good to
  her, if you do not return to receive it."
  The two friends left the camp and plunged at once into the midst
  of the enemy. They found no watch, no sentinels posted, but, all
  about, the sleeping soldiers strewn on the grass and among the wagons.
  The laws of war at that early day did not forbid a brave man to slay a
  sleeping foe, and the two Trojans slew, as they passed, such of the
  enemy as they could without exciting alarm. In one tent Euryalus
  made prize of a helmet brilliant with gold and plumes. They had passed
  through the enemy's ranks without being discovered, but now suddenly
  appeared a troop directly in front of them, which, under Volscens,
  their leader, were approaching the camp. The glittering helmet of
  Euryalus caught their attention, and Volscens hailed the two, and
  demanded who and whence they were. They made no answer, but plunged
  into the wood. The horsemen scattered in all directions to intercept
  their flight. Nisus had eluded pursuit and was out of danger, but
  Euryalus being missing he turned back to seek him. He again entered
  the wood and soon came within sound of voices. Looking through the
  thicket he saw the whole band surrounding Euryalus with noisy
  questions. What should he do? how extricate the youth, or would it
  be better to die with him?
  Raising his eyes to the moon, which now shone clear, he said,
  "Goddess! favour my effort!" and aiming his javelin at one of the
  leaders of the troop, struck him in the back and stretched him on
  the plain with a death-blow. In the midst of their amazement another
  weapon flew and another of the party fell dead. Volscens, the
  leader, ignorant whence the darts came, rushed sword in hand upon
  Euryalus. "You shall pay the penalty of both," he said, and would have
  plunged the sword into his bosom, when Nisus, who from his concealment
  saw the peril of his friend, rushed forward exclaiming, "'Twas I,
  'twas I; turn your swords against me, Rutulians, I did it; he only
  followed me as a friend." While he spoke the sword fell, and pierced
  the comely bosom of Euryalus. His head fell on his shoulder, like a
  flower cut down by the plough. Nisus rushed upon Volscens and
  plunged his sword into his body, and was himself slain on the
  instant by numberless blows.
