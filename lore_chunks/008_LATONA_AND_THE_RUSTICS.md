LATONA AND THE RUSTICS
  JUNO one day perceived it suddenly grow dark, and immediately
  suspected that her husband had raised a cloud to hide some of his
  doings that would not bear the light. She brushed away the cloud,
  and saw her husband on the banks of a glassy river, with a beautiful
  heifer standing near him. Juno suspected the heifer's form concealed
  some fair nymph of mortal mould- as was, indeed, the case; for it
  was Io, the daughter of the river god Inachus, whom Jupiter had been
  flirting with, and, when he became aware of the approach of his
  wife, had changed into that form.
  Juno joined her husband, and noticing the heifer praised its beauty,
  and asked whose it was, and of what herd. Jupiter, to stop
  questions, replied that it was a fresh creation from the earth. Juno
  asked to have it as a gift. What could Jupiter do? He was loath to
  give his mistress to his wife; yet how refuse so trifling a present as
  a simple heifer? He could not, without exciting suspicion; so he
  consented. The goddess was not yet relieved of her suspicions; so
  she delivered the heifer to Argus, to be strictly watched.
  Now Argus bad a hundred eyes in his head, and never went to sleep
  with more than two at a time, so that he kept watch of Io constantly
  He suffered her to feed through the day, and at night tied her up with
  a vile rope round her neck. She would have stretched out her arms to
  implore freedom of Argus, but she had no arms to stretch out, and
  her voice was a bellow that frightened even herself. She saw her
  father and her sisters, went near them, and suffered them to pat her
  back, and heard them admire her beauty. Her father reached her a
  tuft of grass, and she licked the outstretched hand. She longed to
  make herself known to him and would have uttered her wish; but,
  alas! words were wanting At length she bethought herself of writing,
  and inscribed her name- it was a short one- with her hoof on the sand.
  Inachus recognized it, and discovering that his daughter, whom he
  had long sought in vain, was hidden under this disguise, mourned
  over her, and, embracing her white neck, exclaimed, "Alas! my
  daughter, it would have been a less grief to have lost you
  altogether!" While he thus lamented, Argus, observing, came and
  drove her away, and took his seat on a high bank, from whence he could
  see all round in every direction.
  Jupiter was troubled at beholding the sufferings of his mistress,
  and calling, Mercury told him to go and despatch Argus. Mercury made
  haste, put his winged slippers on his feet, and cap on his head,
  took his sleep-producing wand, and leaped down from the heavenly
  towers to the earth. There he laid aside his wings, and kept only
  his wand, with which he presented himself as a shepherd driving his
  flock. As he strolled on he blew upon his pipes. These were what are
  called the Syrinx or Pandean pipes. Argus listened with delight, for
  he had never seen the instrument before. "Young man," said he, "come
  and take a seat by me on this stone. There is no better place for your
  flocks to graze in than hereabouts, and here is a pleasant shade
  such as shepherds love." Mercury sat down, talked, and told stories
  till it grew late, and played upon his pipes his most soothing
  strains, hoping to lull the watchful eyes to sleep, but all in vain;
  for Argus still contrived to keep some of his eyes open though he shut
  the rest.
  Among other stories, Mercury told him how the instrument on which he
  played was invented. "There was a certain nymph, whose name was
  Syrinx, who was much beloved by the satyrs and spirits of the wood;
  but she would have none of them, but was a faithful worshipper of
  Diana, and followed the chase. You would have thought it was Diana
  herself, had you seen her in her hunting dress, only that her bow
  was of horn and Diana's of silver. One day, as she was returning
  from the chase, Pan met her, told her just this, and added more of the
  same sort. She ran away, without stopping to hear his compliments, and
  he pursued till she came to the bank of the river, where be overtook
  her, and she had only time to call for help on her friends the water
  nymphs. They heard and consented. Pan threw his arms around what he
  supposed to be the form of the nymph and found he embraced only a tuft
  of reeds! As he breathed a sigh, the air sounded through the reeds,
  and produced a plaintive melody. The god, charmed with the novelty and
  with the sweetness of the music, said, 'Thus, then, at least, you
  shall be mine.' And he took some of the reeds, and placing them
  together of unequal lengths, side by side, made an instrument which he
  called Syrinx, in honour of the nymph." Before Mercury had finished
  his story he saw Argus's eyes all asleep. As his head nodded forward
  on his breast, Mercury with one stroke cut his neck through, and
  tumbled his head down the rocks. O hapless Argus! the light of your
  hundred eyes is quenched at once! Juno took them and put them as
  ornaments on the tail of her peacock, where they remain to this day.
  But the vengeance of Juno was not yet satiated. She sent a gadfly to
  torment Io, who fled over the whole world from its pursuit. She swam
  through the Ionian sea, which derived its name from her, then roamed
  over the plains of Illyria, ascended Mount Haemus, and crossed the
  Thracian strait, thence named the Bosphorus (cowford), rambled on
  through Scythia, and the country of the Cimmerians, and arrived at
  last on the banks of the Nile. At length Jupiter interceded for her,
  and upon his promising not to pay her any more attentions Juno
  consented to restore her to her form. It was curious to see her
  gradually recover her former self. The coarse hairs fell from her
  body, her horns shrank up, her eyes grew narrower, her mouth
  shorter; hands and fingers came instead of hoofs to her forefeet; in
  fine there was nothing left of the heifer, except her beauty. At first
  she was afraid to speak, for fear she should low, but gradually she
  recovered her confidence and was restored to her father and sisters.
  In a poem dedicated to Leigh Hunt, by Keats, the following
  allusion to the story of Pan and Syrinx occurs:

  "So did he feel who pulled the bough aside,
  That we might look into a forest wide,

  . . . . . . . .

  Telling us how fair trembling Syrinx fled
  Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread.
  Poor nymph- poor Pan- how he did weep to find
  Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind
  Along the reedy stream; a half-heard strain,
  Full of sweet desolation, balmy pain."
