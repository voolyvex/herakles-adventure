SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS
  Ulysses had been warned by Circe of the two monsters Scylla and
  Charybdis. We have already met with Scylla in the story of Glaucus,
  and remember that she was once a beautiful maiden and was changed into
  a snaky monster by Circe. She dwelt in a cave high up on the cliff,
  from whence she was accustomed to thrust forth her long necks (for she
  had six heads), and in each of her mouths seize one of the crew of
  every vessel passing within reach. The other terror, Charybdis, was
  a gulf, nearly on a level with the water. Thrice each day the water
  rushed into a frightful chasm, and thrice was disgorged. Any vessel
  coming near the whirlpool when the tide was rushing in must inevitably
  be ingulfed; not Neptune himself could save it.
  On approaching the haunt of the dread monsters, Ulysses kept
  strict watch to discover them. The roar of the waters as Charybdis
  ingulfed them, gave warning at a distance, but Scylla could nowhere be
  discerned. While Ulysses and his men watched with anxious eyes the
  dreadful whirlpool, they were not equally on their guard from the
  attack of Scylla, and the monster, darting forth her snaky heads,
  caught six of his men, and bore them away, shrieking, to her den. It
  was the saddest sight Ulysses had yet seen; to behold his friends thus
  sacrificed and hear their cries, unable to afford them any assistance.
  Circe had warned him of another danger. After passing Scylla and
  Charybdis the next land he would make was Thrinakia, an island whereon
  were pastured the cattle of Hyperion, the Sun, tended by his daughters
  Lampetia and Phaethusa. These flocks must not be violated, whatever
  the wants of the voyagers might be. If this injunction were
  transgressed destruction was sure to fall on the offenders.
  Ulysses would willingly have passed the island of the Sun without
  stopping, but his companions so urgently pleaded for the rest and
  refreshment that would be derived from anchoring and passing the night
  on shore, that Ulysses yielded. He bound them, however, with an oath
  that they would not touch one of the animals of the sacred flocks
  and herds, but content themselves with what provision they yet had
  left of the supply which Circe had put on board. So long as this
  supply lasted the people kept their oath, but contrary winds
  detained them at the island for a month, and after consuming all their
  stock of provisions, they were forced to rely upon the birds and
  fishes they could catch. Famine pressed them, and at length one day,
  in the absence of Ulysses, they slew some of the cattle, vainly
  attempting to make amends for the deed by offering from them a portion
  to the offended powers. Ulysses, on his return to the shore, was
  horror-struck at perceiving what they had done, and the more so on
  account of the portentous signs which followed. The skins crept on the
  ground, and the joints of meat lowed on the spits while roasting.
  The wind becoming fair they sailed from the island. They had not
  gone far when the weather changed, and a storm of thunder and
  lightning ensued. A stroke of lightning shattered their mast, which in
  its fall killed the pilot. At last the vessel itself came to pieces.
  The keel and mast floating side by side, Ulysses formed of them a
  raft, to which he clung, and, the wind changing, the waves bore him to
  Calypso's island. All the rest of the crew perished.

  The following allusion to the topics we have just been considering
  is from Milton's "Comus," line 252:

  "...I have often heard
  My mother Circe and the Sirens three,
  Amidst the flowery-kirtled Naiades,
  Culling their potent herbs and baneful drugs,
  Who as they sung would take the prisoned soul
  And lap it in Elysium. Scylla wept,
  And chid her barking waves into attention,
  And fell Charybdis murmured soft applause."

  Scylla and Charybdis have become proverbial, to denote opposite
  dangers which beset one's course. See Proverbial Expressions, no. 8.
