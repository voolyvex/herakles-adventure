CAMILLA- EVANDER- NISUS AND EURYALUS-
  MEZENTIUS- TURNUS.

  AENEAS, having parted from the Sibyl and rejoined his fleet, coasted
  along the shores of Italy and cast anchor in the mouth of the Tiber.
  The poet, having brought his hero to this spot, the destined
  termination of his wanderings, invokes his Muse to tell him the
  situation of things at that eventful moment. Latinus, third in descent
  from Saturn, ruled the country. He was now old and had no male
  descendant, but had one charming daughter, Lavinia, who was sought
  in marriage by many neighbouring chiefs, one of whom, Turnus, king
  of the Rutulians, was favoured by the wishes of her parents. But
  Latinus had been warned in a dream by his father Faunus, that the
  destined husband of Lavinia should come from a foreign land. From that
  union should spring a race destined to subdue the world.
  Our readers will remember that in the conflict with the Harpies
  one of those half-human birds had threatened the Trojans with dire
  sufferings. In particular she predicted that before their wanderings
  ceased they should be pressed by hunger to devour their tables. This
  portent now came true; for as they took their scanty meal, seated on
  the grass, the men placed their hard biscuit on their laps, and put
  thereon whatever their gleanings in the woods supplied. Having
  despatched the latter they finished by eating the crusts. Seeing
  which, the boy Iulus said playfully, "See, we are eating our
  tables." AEneas caught the words and accepted the omen. "All hail,
  promised land!" he exclaimed, "this is our home, this our country." He
  then took measures to find out who were the present inhabitants of the
  land, and who their rulers. A hundred chosen men were sent to the
  village of Latinus, bearing presents and a request for friendship
  and alliance. They went and were favourably received. Latinus
  immediately concluded that the Trojan hero was no other than the
  promised son-in-law announced by the oracle. He cheerfully granted his
  alliance and sent back the messengers mounted on steeds from his
  stables, and loaded with gifts and friendly messages.
  Juno, seeing things go thus prosperously for the Trojans, felt her
  old animosity revive, summoned Alecto from Erebus, and sent her to
  stir up discord. The Fury first took possession of the queen, Amata,
  and roused her to oppose in every way the new alliance. Alecto then
  speeded to the city of Turnus, and assuming the form of an old
  priestess, informed him of the arrival of the foreigners and of the
  attempts of their prince to rob him of his bride. Next she turned
  her attention to the camp of the Trojans. There she saw the boy
  Iulus and his companions amusing themselves with hunting. She
  sharpened the scent of the dogs, and led them to rouse up from the
  thicket a tame stag, the favourite of Silvia, the daughter of
  Tyrrheus, the king's herdsman. A javelin from the hand of Iulus
  wounded the animal, and he had only strength left to run homewards,
  and died at his mistress's feet. Her cries and tears roused her
  brothers and the herdsmen, and they, seizing whatever weapons came
  to hand, furiously assaulted the hunting party. These were protected
  by their friends, and the herdsmen were finally driven back with the
  loss of two of their number.
  These things were enough to rouse the storm of war, and the queen,
  Turnus, and the peasants all urged the old king to drive the strangers
  from the country. He resisted as long as he could, but, finding his
  opposition unavailing, finally gave way and retreated to his
  retirement.
