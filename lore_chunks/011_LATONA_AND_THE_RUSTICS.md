LATONA AND THE RUSTICS
  Some thought the goddess in this instance more severe than was just,
  while others praised her conduct as strictly consistent with her
  virgin dignity. As usual, the recent event brought older ones to mind,
  and one of the bystanders told this story: "Some countrymen of Lycia
  once insulted the goddess Latona, but not with impunity. When I was
  young, my father, who had grown too old for active labours, sent me to
  Lycia to drive thence some choice oxen, and there I saw the very
  pond and marsh where the wonder happened. Near by stood an ancient
  altar, black with the smoke of sacrifice and almost buried among the
  reeds. I inquired whose altar it might be, whether of Faunus or the
  Naiads, or some god of the neighbouring mountain, and one of the
  country people replied, 'No mountain or river god possesses this
  altar, but she whom royal Juno in her jealousy drove from land to
  land, denying her any spot of earth whereon to rear her twins. Bearing
  in her arms the infant deities, Latona reached this land, weary with
  her burden and parched with thirst. By chance she espied in the bottom
  of the valley this pond of clear water, where the country people
  were at work gathering willows and osiers. The goddess approached, and
  kneeling on the bank would have slaked her thirst in the cool
  stream, but the rustics forbade her. "Why do you refuse me water?"
  said she; "water is free to all. Nature allows no one to claim as
  property the sunshine, the air, or the water. I come to take my
  share of the common blessing. Yet I ask it of you as a favour. I
  have no intention of washing my limbs in it, weary though they be, but
  only to quench my thirst. My mouth is so dry that I can hardly
  speak. A draught of water would be nectar to me; it would revive me,
  and I would own myself indebted to you for life itself. Let these
  infants move your pity, who stretch out their little arms as if to
  plead for me;" and the children, as it happened, were stretching out
  their arms.
  "'Who would not have been moved with these gentle words of the
  goddess? But these clowns persisted in their rudeness; they even added
  jeers and threats of violence if she did not leave the place. Nor
  was this all. They waded into the pond and stirred up the mud with
  their feet, so as to make the water unfit to drink. Latona was so
  angry that she ceased to mind her thirst. She no longer supplicated
  the clowns, but lifting her hands to heaven exclaimed, "May they never
  quit that pool, but pass their lives there!" And it came to pass
  accordingly. They now live in the water, sometimes totally
  submerged, then raising their heads above the surface or swimming upon
  it. Sometimes they come out upon the bank, but soon leap back again
  into the water. They still use their base voices in railing, and
  though they have the water all to themselves, are not ashamed to croak
  in the midst of it. Their voices are harsh, their throats bloated,
  their mouths have become stretched by constant railing, their necks
  have shrunk up and disappeared, and their heads are joined to their
  bodies. Their backs are green, their disproportioned bellies white,
  and in short they are now frogs, and dwell in the slimy pool.'"

  This story explains the allusion in one of Milton's sonnets, "On the
  detraction which followed upon his writing certain treatises."

  "I did but prompt the age to quit their clogs
  By the known laws of ancient liberty,
  When straight a barbarous noise environs me
  Of owls and cuckoos, asses, apes and dogs.
  As when those hinds that were transformed to frogs
  Railed at Latona's twin-born progeny,
  Which after held the sun and moon in fee."

  The persecution which Latona experienced from Juno is alluded to
  in the story. The tradition was that the future mother of Apollo and
  Diana, flying from the wrath of Juno, besought all the islands of
  the AEgean to afford her a place of rest, but all feared too much
  the potent queen of heaven to assist her rival. Delos alone
  consented to become the birthplace of the future deities. Delos was
  then a floating island; but when Latona arrived there, Jupiter
  fastened it with adamantine chains to the bottom of the sea, that it
  might be a secure resting-place for his beloved. Byron alludes to
  Delos in his "Don Juan":

  "The isles of Greece! the isles of Greece!
  Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
  Where grew the arts of war and peace,
  Where Delos rose and Phoebus sprung!"
