BACCHUS
  BACCHUS was the son of Jupiter and Semele. Juno, to gratify her
  resentment against Semele, contrived a plan for her destruction.
  Assuming the form of Beroe, her aged nurse, she insinuated doubts
  whether it was indeed Jove himself who came as a lover. Heaving a
  sigh, she said, "I hope it will turn out so, but I can't help being
  afraid. People are not always what they pretend to be. If he is indeed
  Jove, make him give some proof of it. Ask him to come arrayed in all
  his splendours, such as he wears in heaven. That will put the matter
  beyond a doubt." Semele was persuaded to try the experiment. She
  asks a favour, without naming what it is. Jove gives his promise,
  and confirms it with the irrevocable oath, attesting the river Styx,
  terrible to the gods themselves. Then she made known her request.
  The god would have stopped her as she spake, but she was too quick for
  him. The words escaped, and he could neither unsay his promise nor her
  request. In deep distress he left her and returned to the upper
  regions. There he clothed himself in his splendours, not putting on
  all his terrors, as when he overthrew the giants, but what is known
  among the gods as his lesser panoply. Arrayed in this, he entered
  the chamber of Semele. Her mortal frame could not endure the
  splendours of the immortal radiance. She was consumed to ashes.
  Jove took the infant Bacchus and gave him in charge to the Nysaean
  nymphs, who nourished his infancy and childhood, and for their care
  were rewarded by Jupiter by being placed, as the Hyades, among the
  stars. When Bacchus grew up he discovered the culture of the vine
  and the mode of extracting its precious juice; but Juno struck him
  with madness, and drove him forth a wanderer through various parts
  of the earth. In Phrygia the goddess Rhea cured him and taught him her
  religious rites, and he set out on a progress through Asia, teaching
  the people the cultivation of the vine. The most famous part of his
  wanderings is his expedition to India, which is said to have lasted
  several years. Returning in triumph, he undertook to introduce his
  worship into Greece, but was opposed by some princes, who dreaded
  its introduction on account of the disorder and madness it brought
  with it.
  As he approached his native city Thebes, Pentheus the king, who
  had no respect for the new worship, forbade its rites to be performed.
  But when it was known that Bacchus was advancing, men and women, but
  chiefly the latter, young and old, poured forth to meet him and to
  join his triumphal march.

  Mr. Longfellow in his "Drinking Song" thus describes the march of
  Bacchus:

  "Fauns with youthful Bacchus follow;
  Ivy crowns that brow, supernal
  As the forehead of Apollo,
  And possessing youth eternal.

  "Round about him fair Bacchantes,
  Bearing cymbals, flutes and thyrses,
  Wild from Naxian groves of Zante's
  Vineyards, sing delirious verses."

  It was in vain Pentheus remonstrated, commanded and threatened.
  "Go," said he to his attendants, "seize this vagabond leader of the
  rout and bring him to me. I will soon make him confess his false claim
  of heavenly parentage and renounce his counterfeit worship." It was in
  vain his nearest friends and wisest counsellors remonstrated and
  begged him not to oppose the god. Their remonstrances only made him
  more violent.
  But now the attendants returned whom he had despatched to seize
  Bacchus. They had been driven away by the Bacchanals, but had
  succeeded in taking one of them prisoner, whom, with his hands tied
  behind him, they brought before the king. Pentheus, beholding him with
  wrathful countenance, said "Fellow! you shall speedily be put to
  death, that your fate may be a warning to others; but though I
  grudge the delay of your punishment, speak, tell us who you are, and
  what are these new rites you presume to celebrate."
  The prisoner, unterrified, responded, "My name is Acetes; my country
  is Maeonia; my parents were poor people, who had no fields or flocks
  to leave me, but they left me their fishing rods and nets and their
  fisherman's trade. This I followed for some time, till growing weary
  of remaining in one place, I learned the pilot's art and how to
  guide my course by the stars. It happened as I was sailing for Delos
  we touched at the island of Dia and went ashore. Next morning I sent
  the men for fresh water, and myself mounted the hill to observe the
  wind; when my men returned bringing with them a prize, as they
  thought, a boy of delicate appearance, whom they had found asleep.
  They judged he was a noble youth, perhaps a king's son, and they might
  get a liberal ransom for him. I observed his dress, his walk, his
  face, There was something in them which I felt sure was more than
  mortal. I said to my men, 'What god there is concealed in that form
  I know not, but some one there certainly is. Pardon us, gentle
  deity, for the violence we have done you, and give success to our
  undertakings.' Dictys, one of my best hands for climbing the mast
  and coming down by the ropes, and Melanthus, my steersman, and
  Epopeus, the leader of the sailor's cry, one and all exclaimed, 'Spare
  your prayers for us.' So blind is the lust of gain! When they
  proceeded to put him on board I resisted them. 'This ship shall not be
  profaned by such impiety,' said I. 'I have a greater share in her than
  any of you.' But Lycabas, a turbulent fellow, seized me by the
  throat and attempted to throw my overboard, and I scarcely saved
  myself by clinging to the ropes. The rest approved the deed.
  "Then Bacchus (for it was indeed he), as if shaking off his
  drowsiness, exclaimed, 'What are you doing with me? What is this
  fighting about? Who brought me here? Where are you going to carry me?'
  One of them replied, 'Fear nothing; tell us where you wish to go and
  we will take you there.' 'Naxos is my home,' said Bacchus; 'take me
  there and you shall be well rewarded.' They promised so to do, and
  told me to pilot the ship to Naxos. Naxos lay to the right, and I
  was trimming the sails to carry us there, when some by signs and
  others by whispers signified to me their will that I should sail in
  the opposite direction, and take the boy to Egypt to sell him for a
  slave, I was confounded and said, 'Let some one else pilot the
  ship;' withdrawing myself from any further agency in their wickedness.
  They cursed me, and one of them, exclaiming, 'Don't flatter yourself
  that we depend on you for our safety,' took my place as pilot, and
  bore away from Naxos.
  "Then the god, pretending that he had just become aware of their
  treachery, looked out over the sea and said in a voice of weeping,
  'Sailors, these are not the shores you promised to take me to;
  yonder island is not my home. What have I done that you should treat
  me so? It is small glory you will gain by cheating a poor boy.' I wept
  to hear him, but the crew laughed at both of us, and sped the vessel
  fast over the sea. All at once- strange as it may seem, it is true,-
  the vessel stopped, in the mid sea, as fast as if it was fixed on
  the ground. The men, astonished, pulled at their oars, and spread more
  sail, trying to make progress by the aid of both, but all in vain. Ivy
  twined round the oars and hindered their motion, and clung to the
  sails, with heavy clusters of berries. A vine, laden with grapes,
  ran up the mast, and along the sides of the vessel. The sound of
  flutes was heard and the odour of fragrant wine spread all around. The
  god himself had a chaplet of vine leaves, and bore in his hand a spear
  wreathed with ivy. Tigers crouched at his feet, and forms of lynxes
  and spotted panthers played around him. The men were seized with
  terror or madness; some leaped overboard; others preparing to do the
  same beheld their companions in the water undergoing a change, their
  bodies becoming flattened and ending in a crooked tail. One exclaimed,
  'What miracle is this!' and as he spoke his mouth widened, his
  nostrils expanded, and scales covered all his body. Another,
  endeavouring to pull the oar, felt his hands shrink up and presently
  to be no longer hands but fins; another, trying to raise his arms to a
  rope, found he had no arms, and curving his mutilated body jumped into
  the sea. What had been his legs became the two ends of a
  crescent-shaped tail. The whole crew became dolphins and swam about
  the ship, now upon the surface, now under it, scattering the spray,
  and spouting the water from their broad nostrils. Of twenty men I
  alone was left. Trembling with fear, the god cheered me. 'Fear not,'
  said he; 'steer towards Naxos.' I obeyed, and when we arrived there, I
  kindled the altars and celebrated the sacred rites of Bacchus."
  Pentheus here exclaimed, "We have wasted time enough on this silly
  story. Take him away and have him executed without delay." Acetes
  was led away by the attendants and shut up fast in prison; but while
  they were getting ready the instruments of execution the prison
  doors came open of their own accord and the chains fell from his
  limbs, and when they looked for him he was nowhere to be found.
  Pentheus would take no warning, but instead of sending others,
  determined to go himself to the scene of the solemnities. The mountain
  Citheron was all alive with worshippers, and the cries of the
  Bacchanals resounded on every side. The noise roused the anger of
  Pentheus as the sound of a trumpet does the fire of a war-horse. He
  penetrated through the wood and reached an open space where the
  chief scene of the orgies met his eyes. At the same moment the women
  saw him; and first among them his own mother, Agave, blinded by the
  god, cried out, "See there the wild boar, the hugest monster that
  prowls in these woods! Come on, sisters! I will be the first to strike
  the wild boar." The whole band rushed upon him, and while he now talks
  less arrogantly, now excuses himself, and now confesses his crime
  and implores pardon, they press upon him and wound him. In vain he
  cries to his aunts to protect him from his mother. Autonoe seized
  one arm, Ino the other, and between them he was torn to pieces,
  while his mother shouted, "Victory! Victory! we have done it; the
  glory is ours!"
  So the worship of Bacchus was established in Greece.

  There is an allusion to the story of Bacchus and the mariners in
  Milton's "Comus," at line 46. The story of Circe will be found in
  Chapter XXIX.

  "Bacchus that first from out the purple grapes
  Crushed the sweet poison of misused wine,
  After the Tuscan mariners transformed,
  Coasting the Tyrrhene shore as the winds listed
  On Circe's island fell; (who knows not Circe,
  The daughter of the Sun? whose charmed cup
  Whoever tasted lost his upright shape,
  And downward fen into a grovelling swine.)"
