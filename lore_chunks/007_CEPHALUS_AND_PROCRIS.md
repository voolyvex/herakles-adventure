CEPHALUS AND PROCRIS
  Cephalus was a beautiful youth and fond of manly sports. He would
  rise before the dawn to pursue the chase. Aurora saw him when she
  first looked forth, fell in love with him, and stole him away But
  Cephalus was just married to a charming wife whom he devotedly
  loved. Her name was Procris. She was a favourite of Diana, the goddess
  of hunting, who had given her a dog which could outrun every rival,
  and a javelin which would never fail of its mark; and Procris gave
  these presents to her husband. Cephalus was so happy in his wife
  that he resisted all the entreaties of Aurora, and she finally
  dismissed him in displeasure, saying, "Go, ungrateful mortal, keep
  your wife, whom, if I am not much mistaken, you will one day be very
  sorry you ever saw again."
  Cephalus returned, and was as happy as ever in his wife and his
  woodland sports. Now it happened some angry deity had sent a
  ravenous fox to annoy the country; and the hunters turned out in great
  strength to capture it. Their efforts were all in vain; no dog could
  run it down; and at last they came to Cephalus to borrow his famous
  dog, whose name was Lelaps. No sooner was the dog let loose than he
  darted off, quicker than their eye could allow him. If they had not
  seen his footprints in the sand they would have thought he flew.
  Cephalus and others stood on a hill and saw the race. The fox tried
  every art; he ran in a circle and turned on his track, the dog close
  upon him, with open jaws, snapping at his heels, but biting only the
  air. Cephalus was about to use his javelin, when suddenly he saw
  both dog and game stop instantly, The heavenly powers who had given
  both were not willing that either should conquer. In the very attitude
  of life and action they were turned into stone. So lifelike and
  natural did they look, you would have thought, as you looked at
  them, that one was going to bark, the other to leap forward.
  Cephalus, though he had lost his dog, still continued to take
  delight in the chase. He would go out at early morning, ranging the
  woods and hills unaccompanied by any one needing no help, for his
  javelin was a sure weapon in all cases. Fatigued with hunting, when
  the sun got high he would seek a shady nook where a cool stream
  flowed, and, stretched on the grass, with his garments thrown aside,
  would enjoy the breeze. Sometimes he would say aloud, "Come, sweet
  breeze, come and fan my breast, come and, lily the heat that burns
  me." Some one passing by one day heard him talking in this way to
  the air, and, foolishly believing, that he was talking to some maiden,
  went and told the secret to Procris, Cephalus's wife. Love is
  credulous. Procris, at the sudden shock, fainted away. Presently
  recovering, she said, "It cannot be true; I will not believe it unless
  I myself am a witness to it." So she waited, with anxious heart,
  till the next morning, when Cephalus went to hunt as usual. Then she
  stole out after him, and concealed herself in the place where the
  informer directed her. Cephalus came as he was wont when tired with
  sport, and stretched himself on the green bank, saying, "Come, sweet
  breeze, come and fan me; you know how I love you! you make the
  groves and my solitary rambles delightful." He was running on in
  this way when he heard, or thought he heard, a sound as of a sob in
  the bushes. Supposing it some wild animal, he threw his javelin at the
  spot. A cry from his beloved Procris told him that the weapon had
  too surely met its mark. He rushed to the place, and found her
  bleeding, and with sinking strength endeavouring to draw forth from
  the wound the javelin, her own gift. Cephalus raised her from the
  earth, strove to stanch the blood, and called her to revive and not to
  leave him miserable, to reproach himself with her death. She opened
  her feeble eyes, and forced herself to utter these few words: "I
  implore you, if you have ever loved me, if I have ever deserved
  kindness at your hands, my husband, grant me this last request; do not
  marry that odious Breeze!" This disclosed the whole mystery: but alas!
  what advantage to disclose it now? She died; but her face wore a
  calm expression, and she looked pityingly and forgivingly on her
  husband when he made her understand the truth.
  Moore, in his "Legendary Ballads," has one on Cephalus and
  Procris, beginning thus:

  "A hunter once in a grove reclined,
  To shun the noon's bright eye,
  And oft he wooed the wandering wind
  To cool his brow with its sigh.
  While mute lay even the wild bee's hum,
  Nor breath could stir the aspen's hair,
  His song was still, 'Sweet Air, O come!'
  While Echo answered, 'Come, sweet Air!'"
