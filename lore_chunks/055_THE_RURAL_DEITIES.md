THE RURAL DEITIES
  PAN, the god of woods and fields, of flocks and shepherds, dwelt
  in grottos, wandered on the mountains and in valleys, and amused
  himself with the chase or in leading the dances of the nymphs. He
  was fond of music, and was, as we have seen, the inventor of the
  syrinx, or shepherd's pipe, which he himself played in a masterly
  manner. Pan, like other gods who dwelt in forests, was dreaded by
  those whose occupations caused them to pass through the woods by
  night, for the gloom and loneliness of such scenes dispose the mind to
  superstitious fears. Hence sudden fright without any visible cause was
  ascribed to Pan, and called a Panic terror.
  As the name of the god signifies all, Pan came to be considered a
  symbol of the universe and personification of Nature; and later
  still to be regarded as a representative of all the gods and of
  heathenism itself.
  Sylvanus and Faunus were Latin divinities, whose characteristics are
  so nearly the same as those of Pan that we may safely consider them as
  the same personage under different names.
  The wood-nymphs, Pan's partners in the dance, were but one class
  of nymphs. There were besides them the Naiads, who presided over
  brooks and fountains, the Oreads, nymphs of mountains and grottos, and
  the Nereids, sea-nymphs. The three last named were immortal, but the
  wood-nymphs, called Dryads or Hamadryads, were believed to perish with
  the trees which had been their abode and with which they had come into
  existence. It was therefore an impious act wantonly to destroy a tree,
  and in some aggravated cases was severely punished, as in the instance
  of Erisichthon, which we are about to record.

  Milton in his glowing description of the early creation, thus
  alludes to Pan as the personification of Nature:

  "...Universal Pan,
  Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,
  Led on the eternal spring."

  And describing Eve's abode:

  "...In shadier bower,
  More sacred or sequestered, though but feigned,
  Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor nymph
  Nor Faunus haunted."
  Paradise Lost, B. IV.

  It was a pleasing trait in the old Paganism that it loved to trace
  in every operation of nature the agency of deity. The imagination
  nation of the Greeks peopled all the regions of earth and sea with
  divinities, to whose agency it attributed those phenomena which our
  philosophy ascribes to the operation of the laws of nature.
  Sometimes in our poetical moods we feel disposed to regret the change,
  and to think that the heart has lost as much as the head has gained by
  the substitution. The poet Wordsworth thus strongly expresses this
  sentiment:

  "...Great God, I'd rather be
  A Pagan, suckled in a creed outworn,
  So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
  Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
  Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea
  And hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn."

  Schiller, in his poem "Die Gotter Griechenlands," expresses his
  regret for the overthrow of the beautiful mythology of ancient times
  in a way which has called forth an answer from a Christian poet,
  Mrs. E. Barrett Browning, in her poem called "The Dead Pan." The two
  following verses are a specimen:

  "By your beauty which confesses
  Some chief Beauty conquering you,
  By our grand heroic guesses
  Through your falsehood at the True,
  We will weep not! earth shall roll
  Heir to each god's aureole,
  And Pan is dead.

  "Earth outgrows the mythic fancies
  Sung beside her in her youth;
  And those debonaire romances
  Sound but dull beside the truth.
  Phoebus' chariot course is run!
  Look up, poets, to the sun!
  Pan, Pan is dead."

  These lines are founded on an early Christian tradition that when
  the heavenly host told the shepherds at Bethlehem of the birth of
  Christ, a deep groan, heard through all the isles of Greece, told that
  the great Pan was dead, and that all the royalty of Olympus was
  dethroned and the several deities were sent wandering in cold and
  darkness. So Milton in his "Hymn on the Nativity":

  "The lonely mountains o'er
  And the resounding shore,
  A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;
  From haunted spring and dale,
  Edged with poplar pale,
  The parting Genius is with sighing sent:
  With flower-enwoven tresses torn,
  The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn."
