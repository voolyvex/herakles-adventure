CALYPSO
  Calypso was a sea-nymph, which name denotes a numerous class of
  female divinities of lower rank, yet sharing many of the attributes of
  the gods. Calypso received Ulysses hospitably, entertained him
  magnificently, became enamoured of him, and wished to retain him for
  ever, conferring on him immortality. But be persisted in his
  resolution to return to his country and his wife and son. Calypso at
  last received the command of Jove to dismiss him. Mercury brought
  the message to her, and found her in her grotto, which is thus
  described by Homer:

  "A garden vine, luxuriant on all sides,
  Mantled the spacious cavern, cluster-hung
  Profuse; four fountains of serenest lymph,
  Their sinuous course pursuing side by side,
  Strayed all around, and everywhere appeared
  Meadows of softest verdure, purpled o'er
  With violets; it was a scene to fill
  A god from heaven with wonder and delight."

  Calypso with much reluctance proceeded to obey the commands of
  Jupiter. She supplied Ulysses with the means of constructing a raft,
  provisioned it well for him, and gave him a favouring gale. He sped on
  his course prosperously for many days, till at length, when in sight
  of land, a storm arose that broke his mast, and threatened to rend the
  raft asunder. In this crisis he was seen by a compassionate sea-nymph,
  who in the form of a cormorant alighted on the raft, and presented him
  a girdle, directing him to bind it beneath his breast, and if he
  should be compelled to trust himself to the waves, it would buoy him
  up and enable him by swimming to reach the land.

  Fenelon, in his romance of "Telemachus," has given us the adventures
  of the son of Ulysses in search of his father. Among other places at
  which he arrived, following on his father's footsteps, was Calypso's
  isle, and, as in the former case, the goddess tried every art to
  keep him with her, and offered to share her immortality with him.
  But Minerva, who in the shape of Mentor accompanied him and governed
  all his movements, made him repel her allurements, and when no other
  means of escape could be found, the two friends leaped from a cliff
  into the sea, and swam to a vessel which lay becalmed off shore. Byron
  alludes to this leap of Telemachus and Mentor in the following stanza:

  "But not in silence pass Calypso's isles,
  The sister tenants of the middle deep;
  There for the weary still a haven smiles,
  Though the fair goddess long has ceased to weep,
  And o'er her cliffs a fruitless watch to keep
  For him who dared prefer a mortal bride.
  Here too his boy essayed the dreadful leap,
  Stern Mentor urged from high to yonder tide;
  While thus of both bereft the nymph-queen doubly sighed."
