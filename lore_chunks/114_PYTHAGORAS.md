PYTHAGORAS
  THE teachings of Anchises to AEneas, respecting the nature of the
  human soul, were in conformity with the doctrines of the Pythagoreans.
  Pythagoras (born five hundred and forty years B.C.) was a native of
  the island of Samos, but passed the chief portion of his life at
  Crotona in Italy. He is therefore sometimes called "the Samian," and
  sometimes "the philosopher of Crotona." When young he travelled
  extensively, and it is said visited Egypt, where he was instructed
  by the priests in all their learning, and afterwards journeyed to
  the East, and visited the Persian and Chaldean Magi, and the
  Brahmins of India.
  At Crotona, where he finally established himself, his
  extraordinary qualities collected round him a great number of
  disciples. The inhabitants were notorious for luxury and
  licentiousness, but the good effects of his influence were soon
  visible. Sobriety and temperance succeeded. Six hundred of the
  inhabitants became his disciples and enrolled themselves in a
  society to aid each other in the pursuit of wisdom, uniting their
  property in one common stock for the benefit of the whole. They were
  required to practise the greatest purity and simplicity of manners.
  The first lesson they learned was silence; for a time they were
  required to be only hearers. "He [Pythagoras] said so" (Ipse dixit),
  was to be held by them as sufficient, without any proof. It was only
  the advanced pupils, after years of patient submission, who were
  allowed to ask questions and to state objections.
  Pythagoras considered numbers as the essence and principle of all
  things, and attributed to them a real and distinct existence; so that,
  in his view, they were the elements out of which the universe was
  constructed. How he conceived this process has never been
  satisfactorily explained. He traced the various forms and phenomena of
  the world to numbers as their basis and essence. The "Monad" or unit
  he regarded as the source of all numbers. The number Two was
  imperfect, and the cause of increase and division. Three was called
  the number of the whole because it had a beginning, middle, and end.
  Four, representing the square, is in the highest degree perfect; and
  Ten, as it contains the sum of the four prime numbers, comprehends all
  musical and arithmetical proportions, and denotes the system of the
  world.
  As the numbers proceed from the monad, so he regarded the pure and
  simple essence of the Deity as the source of all the forms of
  nature. Gods, demons, and heroes are emanations of the Supreme, and
  there is a fourth emanation, the human soul. This is immortal, and
  when freed from the fetters of the body passes to the habitation of
  the dead, where it remains till it returns to the world, to dwell in
  some other human or animal body, and at last, when sufficiently
  purified, it returns to the source from which it proceeded. This
  doctrine of the transmigration of souls (metempsychosis), which was
  originally Egyptian and connected with the doctrine of reward and
  punishment of human actions, was the chief cause why the
  Pythagoreans killed no animals. Ovid represents Pythagoras
  addressing his disciples in these words: "Souls never die, but
  always on quitting one abode pass to another. I myself can remember
  that in the time of the Trojan war I was Euphorbus, the son of
  Panthus, and fell by the spear of Menelaus. Lately being in the temple
  of Juno, at Argos, I recognized my shield hung up there among the
  trophies. All things change, nothing perishes. The soul passes
  hither and thither, occupying now this body, now that, passing from
  the body of a beast into that of a man, and thence to a beast's again.
  As wax is stamped with certain figures, then melted, then stamped anew
  with others, yet is always the same wax, so the soul, being always the
  same, yet wears, at different times, different forms. Therefore, if
  the love of kindred is not extinct in your bosoms, forbear, I
  entreat you, to violate the life of those who may haply be your own
  relatives."

  Shakespeare, in the "Merchant of Venice," makes Gratiano allude to
  the metempsychosis, where he says to Shylock:

  "Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith,
  To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
  That souls of animals infuse themselves
  Into the trunks of men; thy currish spirit
  Governed a wolf, who, hanged for human slaughter,
  Infused his soul in thee; for thy desires
  Are wolfish, bloody, starved and ravenous."

  The relation of the notes of the musical scale to numbers, whereby
  harmony results from vibrations in equal times, and discord from the
  reverse, led Pythagoras to apply the word "harmony" to the visible
  creation, meaning by it the just adaptation of parts to each other.
  This is the idea which Dryden expresses in the beginning of his
  "Song for St. Cecilia's Day":

  "From harmony, from heavenly harmony
  This everlasting frame began;
  From harmony to harmony
  Through all the compass of the notes it ran,
  The Diapason closing full in Man."

  In the centre of the universe (he taught) there was a central
  fire, the principle of life. The central fire was surrounded by the
  earth, the moon, the sun, and the five planets. The distances of the
  various heavenly bodies from one another were conceived to
  correspond to the proportions of the musical scale. The heavenly
  bodies, with the gods who inhabited them, were supposed to perform a
  choral dance round the central fire, "not without song." It is this
  doctrine which Shakespeare alludes to when he makes Lorenzo teach
  astronomy to Jessica in this fashion:

  "Look, Jessica, see how the floor of heaven
  Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold!
  There's not the smallest orb that thou behold'st
  But in his motion like an angel sings,
  Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubim;
  Such harmony is in immortal souls!
  But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
  Doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it."
  Merchant of Venice.

  The spheres were conceived to be crystalline or glassy fabrics
  arranged over one another like a nest of bowls reversed. In the
  substance of each sphere one or more of the heavenly bodies was
  supposed to be fixed, so as to move with it. As the spheres are
  transparent we look through them and see the heavenly bodies which
  they contain and carry round with them. But as these spheres cannot
  move on one another without friction, a sound is thereby produced
  which is of exquisite harmony, too fine for mortal ears to
  recognize. Milton, in his "Hymn on the Nativity," thus alludes to
  the music of the spheres:

  "Ring out, ye crystal spheres!
  Once bless our human ears
  (If ye have power to charm our senses so);
  And let your silver chime
  Move in melodious time;
  And let the bass of Heaven's deep organ blow;
  And with your ninefold harmony
  Make up full concert to the angelic symphony."

  Pythagoras is said to have invented the lyre. Our own poet
  Longfellow, in "Verses to a Child," thus relates the story:

  "As great Pythagoras of yore,
  Standing beside the blacksmith's door,
  And hearing the hammers as they smote
  The anvils with a different note,
  Stole from the varying tones that hung
  Vibrant on every iron tongue,
  The secret of the sounding wire,
  And formed the seven-chorded lyre."

  "The Samian's great AEolian lyre."
