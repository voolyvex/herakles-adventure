ZOROASTER
  OUR knowledge of the religion of the ancient Persians is principally
  derived from the Zendavesta, or sacred books of that people. Zoroaster
  was the founder of their religion, or rather the reformer of the
  religion which preceded him. The time when he lived is doubtful, but
  it is certain that his system became the dominant religion of
  Western Asia from the time of Cyrus (550 B.C.) to the conquest of
  Persia by Alexander the Great. Under the Macedonian monarchy the
  doctrines of Zoroaster appear to have been considerably corrupted by
  the introduction of foreign opinions; but they afterwards recovered
  their ascendency.
  Zoroaster taught the existence of a supreme being, who created two
  other mighty beings and imparted to them as much of his own nature
  as seemed good to him. Of these, Ormuzd (called by the Greeks
  Oromasdes) remained faithful to his creator, and was regarded as the
  source of all good, while Ahriman (Arimanes) rebelled, and became
  the author of all evil upon the earth. Ormuzd created man and supplied
  him with all the materials of happiness; but Ahriman marred this
  happiness by introducing evil into the world, and creating savage
  beasts and poisonous reptiles and plants. In consequence of this, evil
  and good are now mingled together in every part of the world, and
  the followers of good and evil- the adherents of Ormuzd and Ahriman-
  carry on incessant war. But this state of things will not last for
  ever. The time will come when the adherents of Ormuzd shall everywhere
  be victorious, and Ahriman and his followers be consigned to
  darkness for ever.
  The religious rites of the ancient Persians were exceedingly simple.
  They used neither temples, altars, nor statues, and performed their
  sacrifices on the tops of mountains. They adored fire, light, and
  the sun as emblems of Ormuzd, the source of all light and purity,
  but did not regard them as independent deities. The religious rites
  and ceremonies were regulated by the priests, who were called Magi.
  The learning of the Magi was connected with astrology and enchantment,
  in which they were so celebrated that their name was applied to all
  orders of magicians and enchanters.
  Wordsworth thus alludes to the worship of the Persians:

  "...the Persians,- zealous to reject
  Altar and Image, and the inclusive walls
  And roofs of temples built by human hands,-
  The loftiest heights ascending, from their tops,
  With myrtle-wreathed Tiara on his brows,
  Presented sacrifice to Moon and Stars,
  And to the Winds and mother Elements,
  And the whole circle of the Heavens, for him
  A sensitive existence and a God."
  Excursion, Book IV.

  In "Childe Harold" Byron speaks thus of the Persian worship:

  "Not vainly did the early Persian make
  His altar the high places and the peak
  Of earth-o'er-gazing mountains, and thus take
  A fit and unwalled temple, there to seek
  The Spirit, in whose honour shrines are weak,
  Upreared of human hands. Come and compare
  Columns and idol-dwellings, Goth or Greek,
  With Nature's realms of worship, earth and air,
  Nor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer."
  III. 91.

  The religion of Zoroaster continued to flourish even after the
  introduction of Christianity, and in the third century was the
  dominant faith of the East, till the rise of the Mahometan power and
  the conquest of Persia by the Arabs in the seventh century, who
  compelled the greater number of the Persians to renounce their ancient
  faith. Those who refused to abandon the religion of their ancestors
  fled to the deserts of Kerman and to Hindustan, where they still exist
  under the name of Parsees, a name derived from Paris, the ancient name
  of Persia. The Arabs call them Guebers, from an Arabic word signifying
  unbelievers. At Bombay the Parsees are at this day a very active,
  intelligent, and wealthy class. For purity of life, honesty, and
  conciliatory manners, they are favourably distinguished. They have
  numerous temples to Fire, which they adore as the symbol of the
  divinity.
  The Persian religion makes the subject of the finest tale in Moore's
  "Lalla Rookh," the "Fire Worshippers." The Gueber chief says:

  "Yes! I am of that impious race,
  Those slaves of Fire, that morn and even
  Hail their creator's dwelling-place
  Among the living lights of heaven;
  Yes I am of that outcast crew
  To Iran and to vengeance true,
  Who curse the hour your Arabs came
  To desecrate our shrines of flame,
  And swear before God's burning eye
  To break our country's chains or die."
