AND PROCRIS
  THE slime with which the earth was covered by the waters of the
  flood produced an excessive fertility, which called forth every
  variety of production, both bad and good. Among the rest, Python, an
  enormous serpent, crept forth, the terror of the people, and lurked in
  the caves of Mount Parnassus. Apollo slew him with his arrows- weapons
  which he had not before used against any but feeble animals, hares,
  wild goats, and such game. In commemoration of this illustrious
  conquest he instituted the Pythian games, in which the victor in feats
  of strength, swiftness of foot, or in the chariot race was crowned
  with a wreath of beech leaves; for the laurel was not yet adopted by
  Apollo as his own tree.
  The famous statue of Apollo called the Belvedere represents the
  god after this victory over the serpent Python. To this Byron
  alludes in his "Childe Harold," iv. 161:

  "...The lord of the unerring bow,
  The god of life, and poetry, and light,
  The Sun, in human limbs arrayed, and brow
  All radiant from his triumph in the fight.
  The shaft has just been shot; the arrow bright
  With an immortal's vengeance; in his eye
  And nostril, beautiful disdain, and might
  And majesty flash their full lightnings by,
  Developing in that one glance the Deity."
