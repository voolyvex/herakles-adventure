SIVA
  Siva is the third person of the Hindu triad. He is the
  personification of the destroying principle. Though the third name, he
  is, in respect to the number of his worshippers and the extension of
  his worship, before either of the others. In the Puranas (the
  scriptures of the modern Hindu religion) no allusion is made to the
  original power of this god as a destroyer; that power not being to
  be called into exercise till after the expiration of twelve millions
  of years, or when the universe will come to an end; and Mahadeva
  (another name for Siva) is rather the representative of regeneration
  than of destruction.

  The worshippers of Vishnu and Siva form two sects, each of which
  proclaims the superiority of its favourite deity, denying the claims
  of the other, and Brahma, the creator, having finished his work, seems
  to be regarded as no longer active, and has now only one temple in
  India, while Mahadeva and Vishnu have many. The worshippers of
  Vishnu are generally distinguished by a greater tenderness for life,
  and consequent abstinence from animal food, and a worship less cruel
  than that of the followers of Siva.
