RETURN OF ULYSSES
  THE romantic poem of the Odyssey is now to engage our attention.
  It narrates the wanderings of Ulysses (Odysseus in the Greek language)
  in his return from Troy to his own kingdom Ithaca.
  From Troy the vessels first made land at Ismarus, city of the
  Ciconians, where, in a skirmish with the inhabitants, Ulysses lost six
  men from each ship. Sailing thence, they were overtaken by a storm
  which drove them for nine days along the sea till they reached the
  country of the Lotus-eaters. Here, after watering, Ulysses sent
  three of his men to discover who the inhabitants were. These men on
  coming among the Lotus-eaters were kindly entertained by them, and
  were given some of their own food, the lotus-plant, to eat. The effect
  of this food was such that those who partook of it lost all thoughts
  of home and wished to remain in that country. It was by main force
  that Ulysses dragged these men away, and he was even obliged to tie
  them under the benches of his ships.*

  * Tennyson in the "Lotos-eaters," has charmingly expressed the
  dreamy languid feeling which the lotus food is said to have produced.

  "How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream
  With half-shut eyes ever to seem
  Falling asleep in a half-dream!
  To dream and dream, like yonder amber light
  Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height;
  To hear each other's whispered speech;
  Eating the Lotos, day by day,
  To watch the crisping ripples on the beach,
  And tender curving lines of creamy spray:
  To lend our hearts and spirits wholly
  To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;
  To muse and brood and live again in memory,
  With those old faces of our infancy
  Heaped over with a mound of grass,
  Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass."

  They next arrived at the country of the Cyclopses. The Cyclopses
  were giants, who inhabited an island of which they were the only
  possessors. The name means "round eye," and these giants were so
  called because they had but one eye, and that placed in the middle
  of the forehead. They dwelt in caves and fed on the wild productions
  of the island and on what their flocks yielded, for they were
  shepherds. Ulysses left the main body of his ships at anchor, and with
  one vessel went to the Cyclopses' island to explore for supplies. He
  landed with his companions, carrying with them a jar of wine for a
  present, and coming to a large cave they entered it, and finding no
  one within examined its contents. They found it stored with the
  richest of the flock, quantities of cheese, pails and bowls of milk,
  lambs and kids in their pens, all in nice order. Presently arrived the
  master of the cave, Polyphemus, bearing an immense bundle of firewood,
  which he threw down before the cavern's mouth. He then drove into
  the cave the sheep and goats to be milked, and, entering, rolled to
  the cave's mouth an enormous rock, that twenty oxen could not draw.
  Next he sat down and milked his ewes, preparing a part for cheese, and
  setting the rest aside for his customary drink. Then, turning round
  his great eye, he discerned the strangers, and growled out to them,
  demanding who they were, and where from. Ulysses replied most
  humbly, stating that they were Greeks, from the great expedition
  that had lately won so much glory in the conquest of Troy; that they
  were now on their way home, and finished by imploring his
  hospitality in the name of the gods. Polyphemus deigned no answer, but
  reaching out his hand seized two of the Greeks, whom he hurled against
  the side of the cave, and dashed out their brains. He proceeded to
  devour them with great relish, and having made a hearty meal,
  stretched himself out on the floor to sleep. Ulysses was tempted to
  seize the opportunity and plunge his sword into him as be slept, but
  recollected that it would only expose them all to certain destruction,
  as the rock with which the giant had closed up the door was far beyond
  their power to remove, and they would therefore be in hopeless
  imprisonment. Next morning the giant seized two more of the Greeks,
  and despatched them in the same manner as their companions, feasting
  on their flesh till no fragment was left. He then moved away the
  rock from the door, drove out his flocks, and went out, carefully
  replacing the barrier after him. When he was gone Ulysses planned
  how he might take vengeance for his murdered friends, and effect his
  escape with his surviving companions. He made his men prepare a
  massive bar of wood cut by the Cyclops for a staff, which they found
  in the cave. They sharpened the end of it, and seasoned it in the
  fire, and hid it under the straw on the cavern floor. Then four of the
  boldest were selected, with whom Ulysses joined himself as a fifth.
  The Cyclops came home at evening, rolled away the stone and drove in
  his flock as usual. After milking them and making his arrangements
  as before, he seized two more of Ulysses' companions and dashed
  their brains out, and made his evening meal upon them as he had on the
  others. After he had supped, Ulysses approaching him handed him a bowl
  of wine, saying, "Cyclops, this is wine; taste and drink after thy
  meal of men's flesh." He took and drank it, and was hugely delighted
  with it, and called for more. Ulysses supplied him once again, which
  pleased the giant so much that he promised him as a favour that he
  should be the last of the party devoured. He asked his name, to
  which Ulysses replied, "My name is Noman."
  After his supper the giant lay down to repose, and was soon found
  asleep. Then Ulysses with his four select friends thrust the end of
  the stake into the fire till it was all one burning coal, then poising
  it exactly above the giant's only eye, they buried it deeply into
  the socket, twirling it round as a carpenter does his auger. The
  howling monster with his outcry filled the cavern, and Ulysses with
  his aids nimbly got out of his way and concealed themselves in the
  cave. He, bellowing, called aloud on all the Cyclopses dwelling in the
  caves around him, far and near. They on his cry flocked round the den,
  and inquired what grievous hurt had caused him to sound such an
  alarm and break their slumbers. He replied, "O friends, I die, and
  Noman gives the blow." They answered, "If no man hurts thee it is
  the stroke of Jove, and thou must bear it." So saying, they left him
  groaning.
  Next morning the Cyclops rolled away the stone to let his flock
  out to pasture, but planted himself in the door of the cave to feel of
  all as they went out, that Ulysses and his men should not escape
  with them. But Ulysses had made his men harness the rams of the
  flock three abreast, with osiers which they found on the floor of
  the cave. To the middle ram of the three one of the Greeks suspended
  himself, so protected by the exterior rams on either side. As they
  passed, the giant felt of the animals' backs and sides, but never
  thought of their bellies; so the men all passed safe, Ulysses
  himself being on the last one that passed. When they had got a few
  paces from the cavern, Ulysses and his friends released themselves
  from their rams, and drove a good part of the flock down to the
  shore to their boat. They put them aboard with all haste, then
  pushed off from the shore, and when at a safe distance Ulysses shouted
  out, "Cyclops, the gods have well requited thee for thy atrocious
  deeds. Know it is Ulysses to whom thou owest thy shameful loss of
  sight." The Cyclops, hearing this, seized a rock that projected from
  the side of the mountain, and rending it from its bed he lifted it
  high in the air, then exerting all his force, hurled it in the
  direction of the voice. Down came the mass, just clearing the vessel's
  stern. The ocean, at the plunge of the huge rock, heaved the ship
  towards the land, so that it barely escaped being swamped by the
  waves. When they had with the utmost difficulty pulled off shore,
  Ulysses was about to hail the giant again, but his friends besought
  him not to do so. He could not forbear, however, letting the giant
  know that they had escaped his missile, but waited till they had
  reached a safer distance than before. The giant answered them with
  curses, but Ulysses and his friends plied their oars vigorously, and
  soon regained their companions.
  Ulysses next arrived at the island of AEolus. To this monarch
  Jupiter had intrusted the government of the winds, to send them
  forth or retain them at his will. He treated Ulysses hospitably, and
  at his departure gave him, tied up in a leathern bag with a silver
  string, such winds as might be hurtful and dangerous, commanding
  fair winds to blow the barks towards their country. Nine days they
  sped before the wind, and all that time Ulysses had stood at the helm,
  without sleep. At last quite exhausted he lay down to sleep. While
  he slept, the crew conferred together about the mysterious bag, and
  concluded it must contain treasures given by the hospitable King
  AEolus to their commander. Tempted to secure some portion for
  themselves, they loosed the string, when immediately the winds
  rushed forth. The ships were driven far from their course, and back
  again to the island they had just left. AEolus was so indignant at
  their folly that he refused to assist them further, and they were
  obliged to labour over their course once more by means of their oars.
