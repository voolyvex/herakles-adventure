ORACLE OF TROPHONIUS
  Besides the oracles of Jupiter and Apollo, at Dodona and Delphi,
  that of Trophonius in Boeotia was held in high estimation.
  Trophonius and Agamedes were brothers. They were distinguished
  architects, and built the temple of Apollo at Delphi, and a treasury
  for King Hyrieus. In the wall of the treasury they placed a stone,
  in such a manner that it could be taken out; and by this means, from
  time to time, purloined the treasure. This amazed Hyrieus, for his
  locks and seals were untouched, and yet his wealth continually
  diminished. At length he set a trap for the thief and Agamedes was
  caught.
  Trophonius, unable to extricate him, and fearing that when found
  he would be compelled by torture to discover his accomplice, cut off
  his head. Trophonius himself is said to have been shortly afterwards
  swallowed up by the earth.
  The oracle of Trophonius was at Lebadea in Boeotia. During a great
  drought the Boeotians, it is said, were directed by the god at
  Delphi to seek aid of Trophonius at Lebadea. They came thither, but
  could find no oracle. One of them, however, happening to see a swarm
  of bees, followed them to a chasm in the earth, which proved to be the
  place sought.
  Peculiar ceremonies were to be performed by the person who came to
  consult the oracle. After these preliminaries, he descended into the
  cave by a narrow passage. This place could be entered only in the
  night. The person returned from the cave by the same narrow passage,
  but walking backwards. He appeared melancholy and dejected; and
  hence the proverb which was applied to a person low-spirited and
  gloomy, "He has been consulting the oracle of Trophonius."
