ERISICHTHON
  Erisichthon was a profane person and a despiser of the gods, On
  one occasion he presumed to violate with the axe a grove sacred to
  Ceres. There stood in this grove a venerable oak, so large that it
  seemed a wood in itself, its ancient trunk towering aloft, whereon
  votive garlands were often hung and inscriptions carved expressing the
  gratitude of suppliants to the nymph of the tree. Often had the Dryads
  danced round it hand in hand. Its trunk measured fifteen cubits round,
  and it overtopped the other trees as they overtopped the shrubbery.
  But for all that, Erisichthon saw no reason why he should spare it and
  he ordered his servants to cut it down. When he saw them hesitate he
  snatched an axe from one, and thus impiously exclaimed: "I care not
  whether it be a tree beloved of the goddess or not; were it the
  goddess herself it should come down if it stood in my way." So saying,
  he lifted the axe and the oak seemed to shudder and utter a groan.
  When the first blow fell upon the trunk blood flowed from the wound.
  All the bystanders were horror-struck, and one of them ventured to
  remonstrate and hold back the fatal axe. Erisichthon, with a
  scornful look, said to him, "Receive the reward of your piety;" and
  turned against him the weapon which he had held aside from the tree,
  gashed his body with many wounds, and cut off his head. Then from
  the midst of the oak came a voice, "I who dwell in this tree am a
  nymph beloved of Ceres, and dying by your hands forewarn you that
  punishment awaits you." He desisted not from his crime, and at last
  the tree, sundered by repeated blows and drawn by ropes, fell with a
  crash and prostrated a great part of the grove in its fall.
  The Dryads, in dismay at the loss of their companion and at seeing
  the pride of the forest laid low, went in a body to Ceres, all clad in
  garments of mourning, and invoked punishment upon Erisichthon. She
  nodded her assent, and as she bowed her head the grain ripe for
  harvest in the laden fields bowed also. She planned a punishment so
  dire that one would pity him, if such a culprit as he could be pitied-
  to deliver him over to Famine. As Ceres herself could not approach
  Famine, for the Fates have ordained that these two goddesses shall
  never come together, she called an Oread from her mountain and spoke
  to her in these words: "There is a place in the farthest part of
  ice-clad Scythia, a sad and sterile region without trees and without
  crops. Cold dwells there, and Fear and Shuddering, and Famine. Go
  and tell the last to take possession of the bowels of Erisichthon. Let
  not abundance subdue her, nor the power of my gifts drive her away. Be
  not alarmed at the distance" (for Famine dwells very far from
  Ceres), "but take my chariot. The dragons are fleet and obey the rein,
  and will take you through the air in a short time." So she gave her
  the reins, and she drove away and soon reached Scythia. On arriving at
  Mount Caucasus she stopped the dragons and found Famine in a stony
  field, pulling up with teeth and claws the scanty herbage. Her hair
  was rough, her eyes sunk, her face pale, her lips blanched, her jaws
  covered with dust, and her skin drawn tight, so as to show all her
  bones. As the Oread saw her afar off (for she did not dare to come
  near), she delivered the commands of Ceres; and, though she stopped as
  short a time as possible, and kept her distance as well as she
  could, yet she began to feel hungry, and turned the dragons' heads and
  drove back to Thessaly.
  Famine obeyed the commands of Ceres and sped through the air to
  the dwelling of Erisichthon, entered the bedchamber of the guilty man,
  and found him asleep. She enfolded him with her wings and breathed
  herself into him, infusing her poison into his veins. Having
  discharged her task, she hastened to leave the land of plenty and
  returned to her accustomed haunts. Erisichthon still slept, and in his
  dreams craved food, and moved his jaws as if eating. When he awoke,
  his hunger was raging. Without a moment's delay he would have food set
  before him, of whatever kind earth, sea, or air produces; and
  complained of hunger even while he ate. What would have sufficed for a
  city or a nation, was not enough for him. The more he ate the more
  he craved. His hunger was like the sea, which receives all the rivers,
  yet is never filled; or like fire, that burns all the fuel that is
  heaped upon it, yet is still voracious for more.
  His property rapidly diminished under the unceasing demands of his
  appetite, but his hunger continued unabated. At length he had spent
  all and had only his daughter left, a daughter worthy of a better
  parent. Her too he sold. She scorned to be a slave of a purchaser
  and as she stood by the seaside raised her hands in prayer to Neptune.
  He heard her prayer, and though her new master was not far off and had
  his eye upon her a moment before, Neptune changed her form and made
  her assume that of a fisherman busy at his occupation. Her master,
  looking for her and seeing her in her altered form, addressed her
  and said, "Good fisherman, whither went the maiden whom I saw just
  now, with hair dishevelled and in humble garb, standing about where
  you stand? Tell me truly; so may your luck be good and not a fish
  nibble at your hook and get away." She perceived that her prayer was
  answered and rejoiced inwardly at hearing herself inquired of about
  herself. She replied, "Pardon me, stranger, but I have been so
  intent upon my line that I have seen nothing else; but I wish I may
  never catch another fish if I believe any woman or other person except
  myself to have been hereabouts for some time." He was deceived and
  went his way, thinking his slave had escaped. Then she resumed her own
  form. Her father was well pleased to find her still with him, and
  the money too that he got by the sale of her; so he sold her again.
  But she was changed by the favour of Neptune as often as she was sold,
  now into a horse, now a bird, now an ox, and now a stag- got away from
  her purchasers and came home. By this base method the starving
  father procured food; but not enough for his wants, and at last hunger
  compelled him to devour his limbs, and he strove to nourish his body
  by eating his body, till death relieved him from the vengeance of
  Ceres.
