JUGGERNAUT
  Whether the worshippers of juggernaut are to be reckoned among the
  followers of Vishnu or Siva, our authorities differ. The temple stands
  near the shore, about three hundred miles southwest of Calcutta. The
  idol is a carved block of wood, with a hideous face, painted black,
  and a distended blood-red mouth. On festival days the throne of the
  image is placed on a tower sixty feet high, moving on wheels. Six long
  ropes are attached to the tower, by which the people draw it along.
  The priests and their attendants stand round the throne on the
  tower, and occasionally turn to the worshippers with songs and
  gestures. While the tower moves along numbers of the devout
  worshippers throw themselves on the ground, in order to be crushed
  by the wheels, and the multitude shout in approbation of the act, as a
  pleasing sacrifice to the idol. Every year, particularly at two
  great festivals in March and July, pilgrims flock in crowds to the
  temple. Not less than seventy or eighty thousand people are said to
  visit the place on these occasions, when all castes eat together.
