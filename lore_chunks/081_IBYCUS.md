IBYCUS
  In order to understand the story of Ibycus which follows it is
  necessary to remember, first, that the theatres of the ancients were
  immense fabrics capable of containing from ten to thirty thousand
  spectators, and as they were used only on festal occasions, and
  admission was free to all, they were usually filled. They were without
  roofs and open to the sky, and the performances were in the daytime.
  Secondly, the appalling representation of the Furies is not
  exaggerated in the story. It is recorded that AEschylus, the tragic
  poet, having on one occasion represented the Furies in a chorus of
  fifty performers, the terror of the spectators was such that many
  fainted and were thrown into convulsions, and the magistrates
  forbade a like representation for the future.
  Ibycus, the pious poet, was on his way to the chariot races and
  musical competitions held at the Isthmus of Corinth, which attracted
  all of Grecian lineage. Apollo had bestowed on him the gift of song,
  the honeyed lips of the poet, and he pursued his way with lightsome
  step, full of the god. Already the towers of Corinth crowning the
  height appeared in view, and he had entered with pious awe the
  sacred grove of Neptune. No living object was in sight, only a flock
  of cranes flew overhead taking the same course as himself in their
  migration to a southern clime. "Good luck to you, ye friendly
  squadrons," he exclaimed, "my companions from across the sea. I take
  your company for a good omen. We come from far and fly in search of
  hospitality. May both of us meet that kind reception which shields the
  stranger guest from harm!"
  He paced briskly on, and soon was in the middle of the wood. There
  suddenly, at a narrow pass, two robbers stepped forth and barred his
  way. He must yield or fight. But his hand, accustomed to the lyre, and
  not to the strife of arms, sank powerless. He called for help on men
  and gods, but his cry reached no defender's ear. "Then here must I
  die," said he, "in a strange land, unlamented, cut off by the hand
  of outlaws, and see none to avenge my, cause." Sore wounded, he sank
  to the earth, when hoarse screamed the cranes overhead. "Take up my
  cause, ye cranes," he said, "since no voice but yours answers to my
  cry." So saying he closed his eyes in death.
  The body, despoiled and mangled, was found, and though disfigured
  with wounds, was recognized by the friend in Corinth who had
  expected him as a guest. "Is it thus I find you restored to me?" he
  exclaimed. "I who hoped to entwine your temples with the wreath of
  triumph in the strife of song!"
  The guests assembled at the festival heard the tidings with
  dismay. All Greece felt the wound, every heart owned its loss. They
  crowded round the tribunal of the magistrates, and demanded
  vengeance on the murderers and expiation with their blood.
  But what trace or mark shall point out the perpetrator from amidst
  the vast multitude attracted by the splendour of the feast? Did he
  fall by the hands of robbers or did some private enemy slay him? The
  all-discerning sun alone can tell, for no other eye beheld it. Yet not
  improbably the murderer even now walks in the midst of the throng, and
  enjoys the fruits of his crime, while vengeance seeks for him in vain.
  Perhaps in their own temple's enclosure he defies the gods, mingling
  freely in this throng of men that now presses into the amphitheatre.
  For now crowded together, row on row, the multitude fills the
  seats till it seems as if the very fabric would give way. The murmur
  of voices sounds like the roar of the sea, while the circles
  widening in their ascent rise tier on tier, as if they would reach the
  sky.
  And now the vast assemblage listens to the awful voice of the chorus
  personating the Furies, which in solemn guise advances with measured
  step, and moves around the circuit of the theatre. Can they be
  mortal women who compose that awful group, and can that vast concourse
  of silent forms be living beings?
  The choristers, clad in black, bore in their fleshless hands torches
  blazing with a pitchy flame. Their cheeks were bloodless, and in place
  of hair writhing and swelling serpents curled around their brows.
  Forming a circle, these awful beings sang their hymns, rending the
  hearts of the guilty, and enchaining all their faculties. It rose
  and swelled, overpowering the sound of the instruments, stealing the
  judgment, palsying the heart, curdling the blood.
  "Happy the man who keeps his heart pure from guilt and crime! Him we
  avengers touch not; he treads the path of life secure from us. But
  woe! woe! to him who has done the deed of secret murder. We, the
  fearful family of Night, fasten ourselves upon his whole being. Thinks
  he by flight to escape us? We fly still faster in pursuit, twine our
  snakes around his feet, and bring him to the ground. Unwearied we
  pursue; no pity checks our course; still on and on, to the end of
  life, we give him no peace nor rest." Thus the Eumenides sang, and
  moved in solemn cadence, while stillness like the stillness of death
  sat over the whole assembly as if in the presence of superhuman
  beings; and then in solemn march completing the circuit of the
  theatre, they passed out at the back of the stage.
  Every heart fluttered between illusion and reality, and every breast
  panted with undefined terror, quailing before the awful power that
  watches secret crimes and winds unseen the skein of destiny. At that
  moment a cry burst forth from one of the uppermost benches- "Look!
  look! comrade, yonder are the cranes of Ibycus!" And suddenly there
  appeared sailing across the sky a dark object which a moment's
  inspection showed to be a flock of cranes flying directly over the
  theatre. "Of Ibycus! did he say?" The beloved name revived the
  sorrow in every breast. As wave follows wave over the face of the sea,
  so ran from mouth to mouth the words, "Of Ibycus! him whom we all
  lament, whom some murderer's hand laid low! What have the cranes to do
  with him?" And louder grew the swell of voices, while like a
  lightning's flash the thought sped through every heart, "Observe the
  power of the Eumenides! The pious poet shall be avenged! the
  murderer has informed against himself. Seize the man who uttered
  that cry and the other to whom he spoke!"
  The culprit would gladly have recalled his words, but it was too
  late. The faces of the murderers, pale with terror, betrayed their
  guilt. The people took them before the judge, they confessed their
  crime, and suffered the punishment they deserved.
