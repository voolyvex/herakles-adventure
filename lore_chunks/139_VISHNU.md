VISHNU
  Vishnu occupies the second place in the triad of the Hindus, and
  is the personification of the preserving principle. To protect the
  world in various epochs of danger, Vishnu descended to the earth in
  different incarnations, or bodily forms, which descents are called
  Avatars. They are very numerous, but ten are more particularly
  specified. The first Avatar was as Matsya, the Fish, under which
  form Vishnu preserved Manu, the ancestor of the human race, during a
  universal deluge. The second Avatar was in the form of a Tortoise,
  which form he assumed to support the earth when the gods were churning
  the sea for the beverage of immortality, Amrita.
  We may omit the other Avatars, which were of the same general
  character, that is, interpositions to protect the right or to punish
  wrong-doers, and come to the ninth, which is the most celebrated of
  the Avatars of Vishnu, in which he appeared in the human form of
  Krishna, an invincible warrior, who by his exploits relieved the earth
  from the tyrants who oppressed it.
  Buddha is by the followers of the Brahminical religion regarded as a
  delusive incarnation of Vishnu, assumed by him in order to induce
  the Asuras, opponents of the gods, to abandon the sacred ordinances of
  the Vedas, by which means they lost their strength and supremacy.
  Kalki is the name of the tenth Avatar, in which Vishnu will appear
  at the end of the present age of the world to destroy all vice and
  wickedness, and to restore mankind to virtue and purity.
