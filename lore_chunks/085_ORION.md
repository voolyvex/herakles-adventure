ORION
  Orion was the son of Neptune. He was a handsome giant and a mighty
  hunter. His father gave him the power of wading through the depths
  of the sea, or, as others say, of walking on its surface.
  Orion loved Merope, the daughter of OEnopion, king of Chios, and
  sought her in marriage. He cleared the island of wild beasts, and
  brought the spoils of the chase as presents to his beloved; but as
  OEnopion constantly deferred his consent, Orion attempted to gain
  possession of the maiden by violence. Her father, incensed at this
  conduct, having made Orion drunk, deprived him of his sight and cast
  him out on the seashore. The blinded hero followed the sound, of a
  Cyclops' hammer till he reached Lemnos, and came to the forge of
  Vulcan, who, taking pity on him, gave him Kedalion, one of his men, to
  be his guide to the abode of the sun. Placing Kedalion on his
  shoulders, Orion proceeded to the east, and there meeting the sun-god,
  was restored to sight by his beam.
  After this he dwelt as a hunter with Diana, with whom he was a
  favourite, and it is even said she was about to marry him. Her brother
  was highly displeased and often chid her, but to no purpose. One
  day, observing Orion wading through the sea with his head just above
  the water, Apollo pointed it out to his sister and maintained that she
  could not hit that black thing on the sea. The archer-goddess
  discharged a shaft with fatal aim. The waves rolled the dead body of
  Orion to the land, and bewailing her fatal error with many tears,
  Diana placed him among the stars, where he appears as a giant, with
  a girdle, sword, lion's skin, and club. Sirius, his dog, follows
  him, and the Pleiads fly before him.
  The Pleiads were daughters of Atlas, and nymphs of Diana's train.
  One day Orion saw them and became enamoured and pursued them. In their
  distress they prayed to the gods to change their form, and Jupiter
  in pity turned them into pigeons, and then made them a constellation
  in the sky. Though their number was seven, only six stars are visible,
  for Electra, one of them, it is said left her place that she might not
  behold the ruin of Troy, for that city was founded by her son
  Dardanus. The sight had such an effect on her sisters that they have
  looked pale ever since.

  Mr. Longfellow has a poem on the "Occultation of Orion." The
  following lines are those in which he alludes to the mythic story.
  We must premise that on the celestial globe Orion is represented as
  robed in a lion's skin and wielding a club. At the moment the stars of
  the constellation, one by one, were quenched in the light of the moon,
  the poet tells us

  "Down fell the red skin of the lion
  Into the river at his feet.
  His mighty club no longer beat
  The forehead of the bull; but he
  Reeled as of yore beside the sea,
  When blinded by OEnopion
  He sought the blacksmith at his forge,
  And climbing up the narrow gorge,
  Fixed his blank eyes upon the sun."

  Tennyson has a different theory of the Pleiads:

  "Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising through the mellow shade,
  Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid."
  Locksley Hall.

  Byron alludes to the lost Pleiad:

  "Like the lost Pleiad seen no more below."
