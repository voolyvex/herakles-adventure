AND PYGMIES
  MONSTERS, in the language of mythology, were beings of unnatural
  proportions or parts, usually regarded with terror, as possessing
  immense strength and ferocity, which they employed for the injury
  and annoyance of men. Some of them were supposed to combine the
  members of different animals; such were the Sphinx and Chimaera and to
  these all the terrible qualities of wild beasts were attributed,
  together with human sagacity and faculties. Others, as the giants,
  differed from men chiefly in their size; and in this particular we
  must recognize a wide distinction among them. The human giants, if
  so they may be called, such as the Cyclops, Antaeus, Orion, and
  others, must be supposed not to be altogether disproportioned to human
  beings, for they mingled in love and strife with them. But the
  super-human giants, who warred with the gods, were of vastly larger
  dimensions. Tityus, we are told, when stretched on the plain,
  covered nine acres, and Enceladus required the whole of Mount AEtna to
  be laid upon him to keep him down.
  We have already spoken of the war which the giants waged against the
  gods, and of its result. While this war lasted the giants proved a
  formidable enemy. Some of them, like Briareus, had a hundred arms;
  others, like Typhon, breathed out fire. At one time they put the
  gods to such fear that they fled into Egypt and hid themselves under
  various forms. Jupiter took the form of a ram, whence he was
  afterwards worshipped in Egypt as the god Ammon, with curved horns.
  Apollo became a crow, Bacchus a goat, Diana a cat, Juno a cow, Venus a
  fish, Mercury a bird. At another time the giants attempted to climb up
  into heaven, and for that purpose took up the mountain Ossa and
  piled it on Pelion.* They were at last subdued by thunderbolts,
  which Minerva invented, and taught Vulcan and his Cyclops to make
  for Jupiter.
