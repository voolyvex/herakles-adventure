NEPTUNE
  Neptune was the chief of the water deities. The symbol of his
  power was the trident, or spear with three points, with which he
  used to shatter rocks, to call forth or subdue storms, to shake the
  shores and the like. He created the horse and was the patron of
  horse races. His own horses had brazen hoofs and golden manes. They
  drew his chariot over the sea, which became smooth before him, while
  the monsters of the deep gambolled about his path.
