THE COCKATRICE, OR BASILISK
  This animal was called the king of the serpents. In confirmation
  of his royalty, he was said to be endowed with a crest, or comb upon
  the head, constituting a crown. He was supposed to be produced from
  the egg of a cock hatched under toads or serpents. There were
  several species of this animal. One species burned up whatever they
  approached; a second were a kind of wandering Medusa's heads, and
  their look caused an instant horror which was immediately followed
  by death. In Shakespeare's play of "Richard the Third," Lady Anne,
  in answer to Richard's compliment on her eyes, says "Would they were
  basilisk's, to strike thee dead!"
  The basilisks were called kings of serpents because all other
  serpents and snakes, behaving like good subjects, and wisely not
  wishing to be burned up or struck dead, fled the moment they heard the
  distant hiss of their king, although they might be in full feed upon
  the most delicious prey, leaving the sole enjoyment of the banquet
  to the royal monster.
  The Roman naturalist Pliny thus describes him. "He does not impel
  his body, like other serpents, by a multiplied flexion, but advances
  lofty and upright. He kills the shrubs, not only by contact, but by
  breathing on them, and splits the rocks, such power of evil is there
  in him." It was formerly believed that if killed by a spear from on
  horseback the power of the poison conducted through the weapon
  killed not only the rider, but the horse also. To this Lucan alludes
  in these lines:

  "What though the Moor the basilisk hath slain,
  And pinned him lifeless to the sandy plain,
  Up through the spear the subtle venom flies,
  The hand imbibes it, and the victor dies."

  Such a prodigy was not likely to be passed over in the legends of
  the saints. Accordingly we find it recorded that a certain holy man,
  going to a fountain in the desert, suddenly beheld a basilisk. He
  immediately raised his eyes to heaven, and with a pious appeal to
  the Deity laid the monster dead at his feet.
  These wonderful powers of the basilisk are attested by a host of
  learned persons, such as Galen, Avicenna, Scaliger, and others.
  Occasionally one would demur to some part of the tale while he
  admitted the rest. Jonston, a learned physician, sagely remarks, "I
  would scarcely believe that it kills with its look, for who could have
  seen it and lived to tell the story?" The worthy sage was not aware
  that those who went to hunt the basilisk of this sort took with them a
  mirror, which reflected back the deadly glare upon its author, and
  by a kind of poetical justice slew the basilisk with his own weapon.
  But what was to attack this terrible and unapproachable monster?
  There is an old saying that "everything has its enemy"- and the
  cockatrice quailed before the weasel. The basilisk might look daggers,
  the weasel cared not, but advanced boldly to the conflict. When
  bitten, the weasel retired for a moment to eat some rue, which was the
  only plant the basilisks could not wither, returned with renewed
  strength and soundness to the charge, and never left the enemy till he
  was stretched dead on the plain. The monster, too, as if conscious
  of the irregular way in which he came into the world, was supposed
  to have a great antipathy to a cock; and well he might, for as soon as
  he heard the cock crow he expired.
  The basilisk was of some use after death. Thus we read that its
  carcass was suspended in the temple of Apollo, and in private
  houses, as a sovereign remedy against spiders, and that it was also
  hung up in the temple of Diana, for which reason no swallow ever dared
  enter the sacred place.
  The reader will, we apprehend, by this time have had enough of
  absurdities, but still we can imagine his anxiety to know what a
  cockatrice was like. The following is from Aldrovandus, a celebrated
  naturalist of the sixteenth century, whose work on natural history, in
  thirteen folio volumes, contains with much that is valuable a large
  proportion of fables and inutilities. In particular he is so ample
  on the subject of the cock and the bull that from his practice, all
  rambling, gossiping tales of doubtful credibility are called cock
  and bull stories.
  Shelley, in his "Ode to Naples," full of the enthusiasm excited by
  the intelligence of the proclamation of a Constitutional Government at
  Naples, in 1820, thus uses an allusion to the basilisk:

  "What though Cimmerian anarchs dare blaspheme
  Freedom and thee? a new Actaeon's error
  Shall theirs have been,- devoured by their own hounds!
  Be thou like the imperial basilisk,
  Killing thy foe with unapparent wounds!
  Gaze on oppression, till at that dread risk,
  Aghast she pass from the earth's disk.
  Fear not, but gaze,- for freemen mightier grow,
  And slaves more feeble, gazing on their foe."
