APOLLO AND DAPHNE
  Daphne was Apollo's first love. It was not brought about by
  accident, but by the malice of Cupid. Apollo saw the boy playing
  with his bow and arrows; and being himself elated with his recent
  victory over Python, he said to him, "What have you to do with warlike
  weapons, saucy boy? Leave them for hands worthy of them, Behold the
  conquest I have won by means of them over the vast serpent who
  stretched his poisonous body over acres of the plain! Be content
  with your torch, child, and kindle up your flames, as you call them,
  where you will, but presume not to meddle with my weapons." Venus's
  boy heard these words, and rejoined, "Your arrows may strike all
  things else, Apollo, but mine shall strike you." So saying, he took
  his stand on a rock of Parnassus, and drew from his quiver two
  arrows of different workmanship, one to excite love, the other to
  repel it. The former was of gold and ship pointed, the latter blunt
  and tipped with lead. With the leaden shaft he struck the nymph
  Daphne, the daughter of the river god Peneus, and with the golden
  one Apollo, through the heart. Forthwith the god was seized with
  love for the maiden, and she abhorred the thought of loving. Her
  delight was in woodland sports and in the spoils of the chase.
  lovers sought her, but she spurned them all, ranging the woods, and
  taking no thought of Cupid nor of Hymen. Her father often said to her,
  "Daughter, you owe me a son-in-law; you owe me grandchildren." She,
  hating the thought of marriage as a crime, with her beautiful face
  tinged all over with blushes, threw her arms around her father's neck,
  and said, "Dearest father, grant me this favour, that I may always
  remain unmarried, like Diana." He consented, but at the same time
  said, "Your own face will forbid it."
  Apollo loved her, and longed to obtain her; and he who gives oracles
  to all the world was not wise enough to look into his own fortunes. He
  saw her hair flung loose over her shoulders, and said, "If so
  charming, in disorder, what would it be if arranged?" He saw her
  eyes bright as stars; he saw her lips, and was not satisfied with only
  seeing them. He admired her hands and arms, naked to the shoulder, and
  whatever was hidden from view he imagined more beautiful still. He
  followed her; she fled, swifter than the wind, and delayed not a
  moment at his entreaties. "Stay," said he, "daughter of Peneus; I am
  not a foe. Do not fly me as a lamb flies the wolf, or a dove the hawk.
  It is for love I pursue you. You make me miserable, for fear you
  should fall and hurt yourself on these stones, and I should be the
  cause. Pray run slower, and I will follow slower. I am no clown, no
  rude peasant. Jupiter is my father, and I am lord of Delphos and
  Tenedos, and know all things, present and future. I am the god of song
  and the lyre. My arrows fly true to the mark; but, alas! an arrow more
  fatal than mine has pierced my heart! I am the god of medicine, and
  know the virtues of all healing plants. Alas! I suffer a malady that
  no balm. can cure!"
  The nymph continued her flight, and left his plea half uttered.
  And even as she fled she charmed him. The wind blew her garments,
  and her unbound hair streamed loose behind her. The god grew impatient
  to find his wooings thrown away, and, sped by Cupid, gained upon her
  in the race. It was like a hound pursuing a hare, with open jaws ready
  to seize, while the feebler animal darts forward, slipping from the
  very grasp. So flew the god and the virgin- he on the wings of love,
  and she on those of fear. The pursuer is the more rapid, however,
  and gains upon her, and his panting breath blows upon her hair. Her
  strength begins to fail, and, ready to sink, she calls upon her
  father, the river god: "Help me, Peneus! open the earth to enclose me,
  or change my form, which has brought me into this danger!" Scarcely
  had she spoken, when a stiffness seized all her limbs; her bosom began
  to be enclosed in a tender bark; her hair became leaves; her arms
  became branches; her foot stuck fast in the ground, as a root; her
  face became a tree-top, retaining nothing of its former self but its
  beauty, Apollo stood amazed. He touched the stem, and felt the flesh
  tremble under the new bark. He embraced the branches, and lavished
  kisses on the wood. The branches shrank from his lips. "Since you
  cannot be my wife," said he, "you shall assuredly be my tree. I will
  wear you for my crown; I will decorate with you my harp and my quiver;
  and when the great Roman conquerors lead up the triumphal pomp to
  the Capitol, you shall be woven into wreaths for their brows. And,
  as eternal youth is mine, you also shall be always green, and your
  leaf know no decay." The nymph, now changed into a Laurel tree,
  bowed its head in grateful acknowledgment.

  That Apollo should be the god both of music and poetry will not
  appear strange, but that medicine should also be assigned to his
  province, may. The poet Armstrong, himself a physician, thus
  accounts for it:

  "Music exalts each joy, allays each grief,
  Expels diseases, softens every pain;
  And hence the wise of ancient days adored
  One power of physic, melody, and song."

  The story of Apollo and Daphne is of ten alluded to by the poets.
  Waller applies it to the case of one whose amatory verses, though they
  did not soften the heart of his mistress, yet won for the poet
  wide-spread fame:

  "Yet what he sung in his immortal strain,
  Though unsuccessful, was not sung in vain.
  All but the nymph that should redress his wrong,
  Attend his passion and approve his song.
  Like Phoebus thus, acquiring unsought praise,
  He caught at love and filled his arms with bays."

  The following stanza from Shelley's "Adonais" alludes to Byron's
  early quarrel with the reviewers:

  "The herded wolves, bold only to pursue;
  The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the dead;
  The vultures, to the conqueror's banner true,
  Who feed where Desolation first has fed,
  And whose wings rain contagion: how they fled,
  When like Apollo, from his golden bow,
  The Pythian of the age one arrow sped
  And smiled! The spoilers tempt no second blow;
  They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them as they go."
